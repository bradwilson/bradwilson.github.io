<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
    Over the years, I've customized my prompt to maximize the information available to me while
    doing software development. Today it looks like this:
</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/terminal-dark.png" alt="Windows Terminal (dark)" width="1100" /></p>
<p>I also have a light variant:</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/terminal-light.png" alt="Windows Terminal (light)" width="1100" /></p>
<p>
    There's a lot going on in the screenshots, so I'm going to put together the pieces. The
    information here assumes you have general familiarity with customizing your PowerShell
    environment (for example, editing your profile file). It also assumes you have some
    pre-requisites installed, like Git for Windows and Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>
    You can copy/paste along as we go, but I have also provided downloadable versions at
    the end of the blog post.
</p>
<p><em>
    <strong>Important Note:</strong> When saving the PowerShell files, make sure they are saved as
    "UTF-8 with Signature". This will ensure that PowerShell treats your file as UTF-8 and does not
    accidentally treat it as ANSI. Here is an example using my editor of choice,
    <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>:
</em></p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/encoding.png" alt="Encoding in Notepad2" width="375" /></p>

<h2 id="fontscolors">Fonts and Colors</h2>

<p>
    In the original version of this blog post, I described a terminal program I used to use called
    ConEmu. I've since switched to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701">Windows Terminal</a>
    as it provides better compatibility with Windows Subsystem for Linux v2.
</p>

<p>
    The prompt uses several special characters that are not part of a standard font (for example,
    the Git branch symbol in the posh-git banner). The prompt assumes that you have installed and
    are using one the <a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/">Nerd Fonts</a>; the screenshots shown
    here are done with the <a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/Iosevka.zip">Iosevka Nerd Font</a>.
</p>

<p><img class="border" style="padding: 8px; background-color: #2e3436" src="https://www.nerdfonts.com/assets/img/previews/Iosevka Nerd Font.svg" /></p>

<p>
    The Windows Terminal application uses a configuration file. Hit "ctrl comma", and it will launch
    a text editor for you to edit the configuration file. This is the dark and light theme:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="3b81a192a63056e310e453bc7f4c063d" data-gist-file="settings.json" data-gist-line="68-116"></code>

<p>
    The full files (including the Ubuntu icon file that I use) are available here:
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/bradwilson/3b81a192a63056e310e453bc7f4c063d">https://gist.github.com/bradwilson/3b81a192a63056e310e453bc7f4c063d</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="poshgit">posh-git</h2>

<p>
    The blue portion of the prompt is Git project information, powered by
    <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git">posh-git</a>. This is a PowerShell plugin
    that supports printing information about the Git repository referenced by the current
    directory. The great thing about posh-git is that it comes with a tremendous amount
    of flexibility when formatting the prompt output. Here is what it looks like by
    default:
</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/default-poshgit.png" alt="Default posh-git Prompt" width="662" /></p>
<p>
    You configure the prompt by overriding the default values in a configuration object
    that posh-git sets. Here are the overrides which convert that default prompt into
    the blue prompt you've seen above:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="3-63"></code>

<p>
    To use these overrides, place these lines after the <code>Import-Module</code> statement that
    posh-git added to your PowerShell profile. Once you restart your shell, you should see your new
    customizations in place (don't worry about the path; we'll be re-styling that later on):
</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/override-poshgit.png" alt="posh-git Customized Prompt" width="584" /></p>
<p>
    If you want to customize the symbols used in the prompt, the easiest way to find them is by
    using the Character Map application built into Windows. Just select the Nerd Font you're using
    while browsing characters, and you can copy them directly from this app into your profile:
</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/charmap.png" alt="Windows Character Map application" width="476" /></p>

<h2 id="prompt">prompt Function</h2>

<p>
    When PowerShell wants to display your prompt, it executes the command <code>prompt</code>. By default, this
    command is provided by a "PowerShell function". Adding this to your Profile will override the default
    prompt with our custom prompt (I'll break down each meaningful section afterward):
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-lines-expanded="true" data-gist-line="174,303"></code>

<p>
    The <code>findHereOrParent</code> function is used in a few of the prompt pieces (printing the versions of Go, Rust,
    and the .NET SDK) so that the prompt piece will only be shown when you're in a folder of a project that uses the specific
    language. The function itself is fairly straight forward: it looks for any of the given file paths (which supports
    wildcards) in the current folder or any of the parent folders:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="151-170"></code>

<p>Let's break this down into the individual parts of the prompt.</p>

<h3>
    Showing errors
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-error.png" alt="Error display" height="24" />
</h3>

<p>
    The first section of the prompt (red background) is where we optionally show errors that
    have occurred:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="183-199"></code>

<p>
    There are two categories of errors that might happen in PowerShell: internal errors (for example,
    you try to run a command that doesn't exist), and external errors (when you run an executable, and
    the return code is something other than zero). We have separate code for each kind. We reset the
    <code>$Error</code> array and the <code>$LASTEXITCODE</code> values here when we're done.
    Additionally, we detect the "special" exit code of <code>-1073741510</code>
    (<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/batch_script/batch_script_return_code.htm">also known as
    <code>0xC000013A</code></a>) which indicates that the user pressed Ctrl+C to forcefully terminate
    the application.
</p>

<h3>
    Showing custom prompt environments
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-environment.png" alt="Custom prompt environment" height="24" />
</h3>

<p>Next you'll see us printing out custom prompt environments:</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="201-204"></code>

<p>
    This is used by things like the <code>vs2022.ps1</code> script that we will discuss later. The
    assumption is that any text you place into <code>$PromptEnvironment</code> will be shown here.
</p>

<h3>
    Showing the Go version
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-go.png" alt="Go version" height="24" />
</h3>

<p>
    We print the version of Go that's being used, but only do so when in a folder with a Go project (this
    is determined by calling <code>findHereOrParent go.mod</code>). The version is determined by calling
    <code>go version</code> and parsing the result:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="206-210"></code>

<h3>
    Showing the Rust version
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-rust.png" alt="Rust version" height="24" />
</h3>

<p>
    We print the version of Rust that's being used, but only do so when in a folder with a Go project (this
    is determined by calling <code>findHereOrParent Cargo.toml</code>). The version is determined by calling
    <code>rustc --version</code> and parsing the result:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="212-216"></code>

<h3>
    Showing the .NET SDK version
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-dotnetsdk.png" alt=".NET SDK version" height="24" />
</h3>

<p>
    We print the version of the .NET SDK that's being used, but only do so when in a folder with a .NET project (this
    is determined by calling <code>findHereOrParent *.sln,*.csproj</code>; if you use other language types like F#
    or VB.NET, you can add those file types as well). The version is determined by calling <code>dotnet --version</code>;
    this will track SDK versions via <code>global.json</code>, falling back to the latest installed version when not overridden.
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="218-222"></code>

<h3>
    Showing the Kubernetes (kubectl) current context
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-kubectl.png" alt="Kubernetes (kubectl) context" height="24" />
</h3>

<p>
    The gray box in my prompt shows your current kubectl context by calling
    <code>kubectl config current-context</code>:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="224-233"></code>

<h3>
    Showing Azure CLI current subscription
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-az.png" alt="Azure CLI current subscription" height="24" />
</h3>

<p>
    I find it useful to know which Azure subscription is my current subscription when running
    commands via <code>az</code>, so I print out the name of the subscription in my prompt:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="235-249"></code>

<p>Two important notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        This prompt piece requires GNU sed to be somewhere on your PATH. It's typically shipped with
        Git for Windows (in <code>...\usr\bin</code>). You may or may not want this whole folder on your
        PATH; it contains nearly 300 executables as of the writing of this article, so you may instead
        want to set a PowerShell alias to point to that single executable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            I borrowed some code from
            <a href="https://www.dev4sys.com/2016/05/how-to-parse-ini-file-in-powershell.html">dev4sys</a>
            to parse the INI file:
        </p>
        <code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-lines-expanded="true" data-gist-line="67,147"></code>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Showing Git information
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-git.png" alt="Git information" height="24" />
</h3>

<p>
    As we previously saw, posh-git does all the heavy lifting for figuring out the current Git
    status: it shows the current branch name as well as the state of the filesystem (modified
    files, un-tracked files, etc.). All we need to do is print the info:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="251-256"></code>

<h3>
    Showing current path
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-path.png" alt="Current path" height="24" />
</h3>

<p>The last element of the prompt is the current directory:</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="258-264"></code>

<p>The location is normalized to replace your home folder with a tilde, for shorter paths.</p>

<h3>Printing directory stack depth</h3>

<p>
    At the end of the prompt, we print one cyan <code>+</code> symbol for every level deep
    you are in the directory stack (that is, for every un-popped directory you pushed using
    <code>Push-Location</code>, aka <code>pushd</code>):
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="269-275"></code>

<h3>Conditional prompt text &amp; color</h3>

<p>
    I like to know when I'm running as admin or not, and whether my current window is using PowerShell or
    PowerShell Core.
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="277-299"></code>

<p>
    There is a little bit of Windows vs. Unix-ism here to determine whether you're an admin. On Windows,
    we ask the current user identity whether it's in the <code>Administrators</code> group or not; on
    Unix-like environments, we test the user ID against <code>0</code> (meaning, you're <code>root</code>).
    Then when we print the prompt, we use green for (safe) non-admin users, and red for (unsafe) administrators.
</p>

<p>
    The prompt text itself is either <code>PS&gt;</code> for PowerShell, or <code>pwsh&gt;</code> for
    PowerShell Core (regardless of the OS that you're running on).
</p>

<h2 id="environment">Prompt Environment</h2>

<p>
    The final piece of the puzzle is setting the prompt environment. I have several commands which
    place the shell into a special mode to be used for specific environments. For example, I have
    a command called <code>vs2022</code> which adds Visual Studio environment variables just as
    though you'd run the Visual Studio Command Prompt, and then adds that information to the
    printed prompt environment.
</p>

<p>I use a single script which can be used for any version of Visual Studio 2017 (or later):</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="vs.ps1"></code>

<p>And then I use a few simpler commands to invoke it:</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="vs2017.ps1"></code>
<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="vs2019.ps1"></code>
<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="vs2022.ps1"></code>
<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="vspreview.ps1"></code>

<p>
    <code>vs.ps1</code> is a little complex because Visual Studio 2017+ now allows you to install multiple editions
    side by side. It looks to see which edition you have installed and uses the <code>VsDevCmd.bat</code>
    to get the updated environment variables. If you have multiple editions installed, you can use
    the <code>-edition</code> switch to specify which environment you want. In addition, Visual Studio 2022+
    is now 64-bit, so we are forced to look in both 32- and 64-bit Program Files.
</p>
<p>
    The final line of the script sets the global <code>PromptEnvironment</code> variable, which we use
    in our custom prompt function (as shown previously).
</p>

<h2 id="downloads">Downloadable Files</h2>

<p>
    You can download <code>profile.ps1</code> and <code>vs.ps1</code> (and friends) from my
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/bradwilson/d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4">GitHub gist</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    I hope this quick tour through my custom prompt inspires you to make customizations of your
    own, based on your needs. Being able to carefully craft your prompt to be succinct and
    quickly glanceable can be very handy when spending significant time in your command window
    of choice.
</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>
