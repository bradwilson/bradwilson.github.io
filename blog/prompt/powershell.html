        <strong>10 March 2019</strong>: Significantly re-written to include support for kubectl context,
        current Azure subscription, support for current version of posh-git, and support for
        PowerShell core (yes, this all works on Linux and macOS now!).

        <strong>20 August 2017</strong>: Initial revision.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>Whenever I post a screen shot of my PowerShell prompt, people ask me how it's put together:</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/conemu.png" alt="ConEmu ScreenShot" width="624" /></p>
<p>
    There's a lot going on in this screenshot, so I'm going to put together the pieces. The
    information here assumes you have general familiarity with customizing your PowerShell
    environment (for example, editing your profile file). It also assumes you have some
    pre-requisites installed, like Git for Windows and Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>
    You can copy/paste along as we go, but I have also provided downloadable versions at
    the end of the blog post.
</p>
<p><em>
    <strong>Important Note:</strong> When saving the PowerShell files, make sure they are saved as
    "UTF-8 with Signature". This will ensure that PowerShell treats your file as UTF-8 and does not
    accidentally treat it as ANSI. Here is an example using my editor of choice,
    <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>:
</em></p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/encoding.png" alt="Encoding in Notepad2" /></p>

<h2 id="fontscolors">Fonts and Colors</h2>
<p>
    On Windows, I use a console program called <a href="https://conemu.github.io/">ConEmu</a>. and I've
    chosen it because its configuration allows me to get exactly what I want, in a portable executable.
    (I keep most of my utilities like this in the cloud, so that I can just sync them down to a new
    machine with no installation.)
</p>
<p>
    The most critical feature that I'm leveraging here is the ability of ConEmu to create a
    slightly compressed font display without needing an actual condensed font. Speaking of
    fonts, I use a font from the awesome <a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/">Nerd Fonts</a>
    project to provide several of the custom symbols in my prompt. It joins together
    icons from several projects (including Powerline, Font Awesome, and Octicons), and creates
    pre-merged versions of their font based on several free, fixed pitch fonts (my prompt is using
    <a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/UbuntuMono/Regular/complete/Ubuntu%20Mono%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono%20Windows%20Compatible.ttf?raw=true">Ubuntu Mono</a>).
</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/font.png" alt="ConEmu Font Settings" /></p>
<p>
    I get the slightly condensed look with the "Width" setting (width of 9 against font size
    of 20).
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, I use a custom color set (based heavily on the Ubuntu default terminal colors).
    The colors I've chosen for many of the prompt elements are based on the mix of these custom
    colors; if you choose to stick with the default color values, you may wish to adjust some
    of my color choices for better legibility.
</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/colors.png" alt="ConEmu Colors" /></p>
<p><em>
    <strong>Important note:</strong> Because there are use of Unicode characters in many of the
    samples, please make sure your text editor is capable of editing files in UTF-8 mode. If you
    see <code>?</code> characters where you expect to see custom symbols, make sure that your
    file is in UTF-8 mode, and that your text editor is using your custom Nerd Font.
</em></p>

<h2 id="poshgit">posh-git</h2>

<p>
    The blue portion of the prompt is Git project information, powered by
    <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git">posh-git</a>. This is a PowerShell plugin
    that supports printing information about the Git repository referenced by the current
    directory. The great thing about posh-git is that it comes with a tremendous amount
    of flexibility when formatting the prompt output. Here is what it looks like by
    default:
</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/default-poshgit.png" alt="Default posh-git Prompt" /></p>
<p>
    You configure the prompt by overriding the default values in a configuration object
    that posh-git sets. Here are the overrides which convert that default prompt into
    the blue prompt you've seen above:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="3-55"></code>

<p>
    To use these overrides, place these lines after the <code>Import-Module</code> statement that
    posh-git added to your PowerShell profile. Once you restart your shell, you should see your new
    customizations in place (don't worry about the path; we'll be re-styling that later on):
</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/override-poshgit.png" alt="post-git Customized Prompt" /></p>
<p>
    If you want to customize the symbols used in the prompt, the easiest way to find them is by
    using the Character Map application built into Windows. Just select the Nerd Font you're using
    while browsing characters, and you can copy them directly from this app into your profile:
</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/prompt/powershell/charmap.png" alt="Windows Character Map application" /></p>

<h2 id="prompt">prompt Function</h2>

<p>
    When PowerShell wants to display your prompt, it executes the command <code>prompt</code>. By default, this
    command is provided by a "PowerShell function". Adding this to your Profile will override the default
    prompt with our custom prompt (I'll break down each meaningful section afterward):
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-lines-expanded="true" data-gist-line="59,166"></code>

<p>Let's break this down into the individual parts of the prompt.</p>

<h3>
    Showing errors
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-error.png" alt="Error display" width="45" />
</h3>

<p>
    The first section of the prompt (red background) is where we optionally show errors that
    have occurred:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="66-78"></code>

<p>
    There are two categories of errors that might happen in PowerShell: internal errors (for example,
    you try to run a command that doesn't exit), and external errors (when you run an executable, and
    the return code is something other than zero). We have separate code for each kind. We reset the
    <code>$Error</code> array and the <code>$LASTEXITCODE</code> values here when we're done.
</p>

<h3>
    Showing custom prompt environments
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-environment.png" alt="Custom prompt environment" width="70" />
</h3>

<p>Next you'll see us printing out custom prompt environments:</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="80-84"></code>

<p>
    This is used by things like the <code>vs2017.ps1</code> script that we will discuss later. The
    assumption is that any text you place into <code>$PromptEnvironment</code> will be shown here
    as-is (in White on DarkMagenta).
</p>

<h3>
    Showing the Kubernetes (kubectl) current context
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-kubectl.png" alt="Kubernetes (kubectl) context" width="66" />
</h3>

<p>The gray box in my prompt shows your current kubectl context:</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="86-97"></code>

<h3>
    Showing Azure CLI current subscription
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-az.png" alt="Azure CLI current subscription" width="167" />
</h3>

<p>
    I find it useful to know which Azure subscription is my current subscription when running
    commands via <code>az</code>, so I print out the name of the subscription in my prompt:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="99-111"></code>

<p>
    One thing to note here is that I used <code>sed</code> for the string parsing, mostly because
    I wrote this parser for Bash on Linux before I wrote it for PowerShell. There is no built-in
    way to parse INI files (in either shell), so sed ends up filling this role. You'll need a
    version of Gnu sed somewhere on your path; I pull mine from the Git for Windows installation
    (by putting <code>...\usr\bin</code> folder on my PATH).
</p>

<h3>
    Showing Git information
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-git.png" alt="Git information" width="74" />
</h3>

<p>
    As we previously saw, posh-git does all the heavy lifting for figuring out the current Git
    status: it shows the current branch name as well as the state of the filesystem (modified
    files, un-tracked files, etc.). All we need to do is print the info:
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="113-118"></code>

<h3>
    Showing current path
    <img class="border prompt-piece" src="/images/prompt/powershell/piece-path.png" alt="Current path" width="171" />
</h3>

<p>The last element of the prompt is the current directory:</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="120-127"></code>

<p>
    The location is normalized to replace your home folder with
</p>

<h3>Printing directory stack depth</h3>

<p>
    At the end of the prompt, we print one cyan <code>+</code> symbol for every level deep
    you are in the directory stack (that is, for every un-popped directory you pushed using
    <code>Push-Location</code>, aka <code>pushd</code>):
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="132-136"></code>

<h3>Conditional prompt text &amp; color</h3>

<p>
    I like to know when I'm running as admin or not, and whether my current window is using PowerShell or
    PowerShell Core.
</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="profile.ps1" data-gist-line="141-162"></code>

<p>
    There is a little bit of Windows vs. Unix-ism here to determine whether you're an admin. On Windows,
    we ask the current user identity whether it's in the <code>Administrators</code> group or not; on
    Unix-like environments, we test the user ID against <code>0</code> (meaning, you're <code>root</code>).
    Then when we print the prompt, we use green for (safe) non-admin users, and red for (unsafe) administrators.
</p>

<p>
    The prompt text itself is either <code>PS&gt;</code> for PowerShell, or <code>pwsh&gt;</code> for
    PowerShell Core (regardless of the OS that you're running on).
</p>

<h2 id="environment">Prompt Environment</h2>

<p>
    The final piece of the puzzle is printing the prompt environment. I have several commands which
    place the shell into a special mode to be used for specific environments. For example, I have
    a command called <code>vs2017</code> which adds Visual Studio environment variables just as
    though you'd run the Visual Studio Command Prompt, and then adds that information to the
    printed prompt environment.
</p>

<p>I use a single script which can be used for any version of Visual Studio 2017 (or later):</p>

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="vs.ps1"></code>

And then I use a few simpler commands to invoke it:

<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="vs2017.ps1"></code>
<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="vs2019.ps1"></code>
<code class="transparent" data-gist-id="d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4" data-gist-file="vspreview.ps1"></code>

<p>
    <code>vs.ps1</code> is a little complex because Visual Studio 2017+ now allows you to install multiple editions
    side by side. It looks to see which edition you have installed and uses the <code>VsDevCmd.bat</code>
    to get the updated environment variables. If you have multiple editions installed, you can use
    the <code>-edition</code> switch to specify which environment you want.
</p>
<p>
    The final line of the script sets the global <code>PromptEnvironment</code> variable, which we use
    in our custom prompt function (as shown previously).
</p>

<h2 id="downloads">Downloadable Files</h2>

<p>
    You can download <code>profile.ps1</code> and <code>vs.ps1</code> (and friends) from my
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/bradwilson/d965fa17fd3b3eee168270122e0f7da4#file-vs2017-ps1">GitHub gist</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    I hope this quick tour through my custom prompt inspires you to make customizations of your
    own, based on your needs. Being able to carefully craft your prompt to be succinct and
    quickly glanceable can be very handy when spending significant time in your command window
    of choice.
</p>

<p>
    Here is the prompt from one of my <a href="https://system76.com/pop">Pop!_OS 18.10</a> Linux machines,
    running in PowerShell Core:
