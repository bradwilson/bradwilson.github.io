<h1>Bid Euchre <a href="."><span class="fas fa-trophy"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  A variation on the classic card game <a href="euchre.html">Euchre</a>. You
  should be familiar with the rules of Euchre before playing this game.
</p>

<h2>Players</h2>

<p>2 players</p>

<h2>Cards</h2>

<p>One standard euchre deck (2-8s removed).</p>

<h2>Object</h2>

<p>The object is to get to a predetermined score, typically 50 points.</p>

<h2>Dealing</h2>

<p>
  The dealer will place one card face down in front of the opponent, then one
  card face down in front of himself. He will do this four times. This will
  create four piles. Then the dealer deals four more cards, this time face up,
  on top of the four piles he has created. Then he deals the rest of the cards
  one at a time. These remaining four cards are taken into the players' hand.
</p>

<h2>Game play</h2>

<p>
  There are twelve tricks to be taken. The opponent begins by bidding the number
  of tricks they think they can take. Bidding goes back and forth until someone
  relents. The winning bidder names trump. The non-dealer plays the first card.
</p>

<p>
  When a card is played that is the up card on one of the players' piles, the
  down card stays down until the trick is completed. At that time, the down card
  is turned up for both players to see. Because these four cards are out of play
  until they are turned up and known, it is possible for someone to be
  short-suited until one of their down cards is flipped.
</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>
  One point is scored for each trick taken. If the person who bid does not take
  their bid in tricks, they are marked with a negative number of points equal
  to their bid. The defender always scores the number of tricks they have taken.
