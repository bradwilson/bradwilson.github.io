<h1>Cut-Throat Euchre <a href="."><span class="fa fa-trophy"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  A variation on the classic card game <a href="euchre.html">Euchre</a>. You
  should be familiar with the rules of Euchre before playing this game.
</p>

<h2>Players:</h2>

<p>3 players</p>

<h2>Cards:</h2>

<p>One euchre deck</p>

<h2>Object:</h2>

<p>
  The object is to be the first person to score a predetermined number of points,
  typically 15.
</p>

<h2>Dealing:</h2>

<p>
  A regular euchre deal is performed. The fourth hand is called the "dead" hand,
  and is always dealt in the same position on the table.
</p>

<h2>Game play:</h2>

<p>
  The turned up card will be trump, and will be picked up by the dealer. Starting
  with the player to the left of the dealer, each player has an opportunity to
  swap their cards with the dead hand. They do not have an opportunity to look
  at the dead hand beforehand. Once they've swapped their hand with the dead
  hand, they may not swap back. However, if the first player swaps his hand for
  the dead hand, his old hand now becomes the new dead hand. The second player
  may still trade his hand for the new dead hand.
</p>

<p>
  Once the dealer has decided to keep or swap his hand for the dead hand, he
  will take the flipped up card and discard one card. The first player to the
  left of the dealer leads.
</p>

<h2>Scoring:</h2>

<p>
  Each player gets one point for each trick they capture. If they don't capture
  any tricks, they are given -3 points. If one player captures all five tricks,
  he gets his five tricks, and the other two players are given -5 points
  instead of -3 points.
