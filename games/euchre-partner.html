<h1>Call-Your-Partner Euchre <a href="."><span class="fa fa-trophy"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  A variation on the classic card game <a href="euchre.html">Euchre</a>. You
  should be familiar with the rules of Euchre before playing this game.
</p>

<h2>Players:</h2>

<p>5 players</p>

<h2>Cards:</h2>

<p>One standard deck with 2s thru 7s removed</p>

<h2>Object:</h2>

<p>The object is to get to a predetermined score, typically 10 points.</p>

<h2>Dealing:</h2>

<p>
  The game is dealt much like a standard euchre game, except that there are five
  players, and there will only be 3 cards left when dealing is completed, rather
  than 4. Like standard euchre, the top card of the remaining three is flipped
  up and placed on the pile in front of the dealer.
</p>

<h2>Game play:</h2>

<p>
  Play is very much like standard euchre. Trump is determined the same way.
</p>

<p>
  The person who calls trump is allowed to call their partner, if they wish. The
   call their partner by naming a non-trump card. If they are ordering the dealer
   to pick up the trump card, they will reveal their called card after the dealer
   has discarded, to prevent the dealer from discarding the called card
   intentionally. The caller may also elect to go alone (ie, not call a
   partner).
 </p>

<p>
  The player that has the called card is their partner. However, they cannot
  reveal that information until they play the called card, so it will not be
  immediately apparent who the caller's partner is.
</p>

<p>
  Because three cards are buried, it is possible that the person who makes
  trump and calls for a partner will not have one, because the card they called
  may be buried.
</p>

<h2>Scoring:</h2>

<p>
  Score is much like traditional euchre. The team that called trump is given one
  point if they get three or four of the tricks; they are given two points if
  they get all five tricks. If they get less than three tricks, then the
  defending team is given two points.
</p>

<p>
  If the caller goes alone, either by choice or because the called card is
  buried, then they are given five points if they take all five tricks.
</p>

<p>
  Because the "partners" change for each hand, each player must individually
  keep their own score. If playing to 10, you can use 5/5 for two players, 4/6
  for two players, and 3/7 for one player, or you may use paper or poker chips
  for keeping score.
