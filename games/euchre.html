<h1>Traditional Euchre <a href="."><span class="fa fa-trophy"></span></a></h1>

<h2>Players</h2>

<p>4 (two teams, partners sit across from each other)</p>

<h2>Cards</h2>

<p>
  One euchre deck (one standard deck with 2s through 8s removed, and the 5s set
  aside for scoring)
</p>

<h2>Object</h2>

<p>The game is over when one team gets at least 10 points.</p>

<h2>Dealing</h2>

<p>
  There are lots of variations on dealing, but the point is to deal all the cards
  going around twice. Some tournaments require "standard dealing", which is:
  3 cards to the person to the left of the dealer, then 2 cards, then 3, then 2
  to the dealer; then 2 to the person to the left of the dealer, then 3, then 2,
  then 3. No matter how you deal, each person should have 5 cards, and there
  should be 4 cards left over.
</p>

<h2>Game play</h2>

<p>
  After the dealer deals the cards, there should be four cards left. The top
  card of the four cards left is turned up. It is important to catch any misdeals
  (count the four cards!) before you turn the card up; if a misdeal is caught
  after the card is turned up, the deal passes to the left; if a misdeal is
  caught before the card is turned up, the cards are collected and re-dealt by
  the same player (see "Misdeal rules" in the <strong>Variations</strong> section).
</p>

<p>The suit of the card that is turned up is offered for trump.</p>

<p>
  A trump suit means a suit that beats the other suits when cards are played.
  For example, if hearts are trump, then a heart will always beat a non heart.
  There is no value to other suits other than trump; one non trump suit does not
  beat another non trump suit.
</p>

<p>In euchre, the value of cards for trump is (highest first):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Jack of trump (called the "right bower")</li>
  <li>Jack of other suit of same color (called the "left bower")</li>
  <li>Ace of trump</li>
  <li>King</li>
  <li>Queen</li>
  <li>Ten</li>
  <li>Nine</li>
</ol>

<p>
  For the non trump suits, the normal order is used (A-K-Q-J-10-9). Note that
  the Jack of the same color as trump (left bower) is considered to be trump
  for that hand.
</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Hearts is trump.</p>

  <p>The order from highest to lowest of trump cards is:</p>

  <p>
    J<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    J<span class="suit diamond">♦</span>
    A<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    K<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    Q<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    10<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    9<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
  </p>

  <p>The order from highest to lowest of diamonds is:</p>

  <p>
    A<span class="suit diamond">♦</span>
    K<span class="suit diamond">♦</span>
    Q<span class="suit diamond">♦</span>
    10<span class="suit diamond">♦</span>
    9<span class="suit diamond">♦</span>
  </p>

  <p>The jack of diamonds is considered a heart for this hand.</p>
</div>

<p>
  When cards are played, you must follow suit (play the same suit as the first
  card played) if you have a card (or cards) in that suit. If you do not have
  cards in that suit, you may play trump (to try and take the trick), or you
  may play another suit (and waste the card).
</p>

<p>
  The suit of the card that is turned up is offered for trump. The person to the
  left of the dealer decides if they want that suit to be trump. If they do,
  they order the dealer to pick up the card (the dealer will discard another
  one, to get back to 5 cards), and trump is made. If they do not, they say
  "pass". If they pass, the next person in clockwise order can choose. If all
  pass, they dealer has the option to make that suit trump by taking the card
  into his hand and discarding one, or passing by turning the card over.
</p>

<p>
  If the dealer turns over the card, then the person to the left of the dealer
  now has the option to call any other suit trump if they wish, or they may pass
  again (they cannot call the suit of the card that was turned over). If all
  three players pass a second time, then the dealer may call a trump suit, or
  if he chooses to pass, the cards are collected, and the deal moves to the next
  person to the left, with no points scored for either team (see "Screw The
  Dealer" in the <strong>Variations</strong> section).
</p>

<p>
  The two partners work together to take tricks. If the team that calls trump
  collects 3 or 4 tricks, they are given one point; if they collect all 5 tricks,
  they are given two points. If the team that calls trump does not collect at
  least 3 tricks, the opposing team is given 2 points (this is called
  "euchering your opponent").
</p>

<p>
  When declaring trump, a person may choose to "go alone". This means that they
  believe they can get the required tricks without their partner's assistance.
  If they do get all 5 tricks, they are given 4 points instead of 2 (see "Cross
  Corner Alone" in the <strong>Variations</strong> section).
</p>

<p>
  Once trump is set, the person to the left of the dealer plays first. If that
  person is not playing because someone is going alone, then the first playing
  player to the left of the dealer plays first (see "Leading Alone" in the
  <strong>Variations</strong> section). The player will play a single card.
  Each player must follow suit if they have it, or they may choose to play
  trump or an off suit. A trump card will beat a non-trump card.
</p>

<p>
  The winning team collects the trick, and the person who played the card that
  won the trick is the person who leads for the next trick. The hand is over
  when all 5 tricks have been played.
</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>
  Each team has two fives which are used for scoring. In the beginning of play,
  place one five face up, then the other five face down on top of it. As you mark
  the first five points, expose the five pips on the bottom five. When you get
  five points, flip the top card over, and expose the bottom five pips for six
  through ten.
</p>

<h2>Variants</h2>

<p>
  There are quite a few possible variants on how Euchre is played. Personally,
  we always play "First Black Jack Deals", and occasionally play "Screw the
  Dealer".
</p>

<p><strong>"First Black Jack Deals"</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Someone takes the deck and shuffles the cards, then deals the cards one at
    a time, face up, to each player, starting with the first player to the left
    of the person dealing, and moving clockwise. You stop when the first black
    jack is turned up; this person is the first dealer.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Misdeal rules</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>"Farmer's Hand" (or "No Ace, No Face")</strong> -- if your hand
    contains all 9s and 10s, you can declare a misdeal before bidding for trump.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>"Ace, No Face"</strong> -- if your hand contains one ace, and the
    rest 9s and 10s, you can declare a misdeal before bidding for trump.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>"Stick the Dealer"</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    When you play with this variant, the dealer is not allowed to pass on the
    second time around. He must call a trump suit (other than the suit that was
    turned over, of course).
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>"Cross Corner Alone"</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    When a person chooses to go alone, one of the other team members may also
    choose to go alone. If the opposing alone person manages to collect all 5
    tricks, they will score 4 points instead of 2.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>"Leading Alone"</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Some people play that you are not allowed to lead if you are playing alone
    (except for "cross corner alone", where the opposing alone person will
    always get to lead). This adds an element of difficult to going alone.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>"Alone, Partner's Best"</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    When you go alone, you can call "partner's best". The person going alone
    discards one card to the dead pile; their partner slides their best card
    across the table to them face down, and they put it in their hand.
  </p>
</blockquote>
