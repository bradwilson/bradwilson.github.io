<h1>Farkle <a href="."><span class="fa fa-trophy"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  Farkle is an ages-old dice game. It has the advantage that it can be
  played with just a set of 6 dice and some paper for scoring. It
  requires no cards, the counting is easy, and it can be taught in just a
  few minutes. It also contains a good deal of strategy.
</p>

<h2>Players</h2>

<p>At least two players (the more the merrier!)</p>

<h2>Equipment</h2>

<p>
  Six traditional dice (6-sided)<br />
  Pencil and paper to keep score
</p>

<h2>Object</h2>

<p>Be the first player to 10,000 points by rolling dice.</p>

<h2>Play</h2>

<p>
  Farkle is played in rounds. At the beginning of each round, the
  player throws all six dice. If no dice can score, the round is over and
  the player has Farkled. After each throw, the player must set aside at
  least one scoring die. Then the player has two choices: either stop
  rolling and take their points, or continue to roll and risk their
  accumulated points for that round. There is a required minimum point
  total before you can stop, which is explained below.
</p>

<p>
  If the player has set aside all six dice for scoring, then they
  continue the round by throwing all six dice anew (and keeping the score
  they have so far for the round).
</p>

<p>
  Once the round is over, if the player stopped voluntarily, their
  score is added to their total and the new total is recorded on the
  paper; if the player Farkled, they do not get any score for the round
  (and their total score remains unchanged).
</p>

<p>
  If the player's total score is zero (i.e., it's their first turn, or
  they have thus far only Farkled), then they must have set aside at
  least 1,000 points before they can stop rolling the dice for the round.
  After they have recorded points successfully, they need only achieve at
  least 350 points before they can stop rolling dice for the round.
</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>The scoring dice are (in a single roll):</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-nonfluid">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Combination</th>
      <th>Points</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Single die</strong><br />
        1 spot<br />
        5 spot
      </td>
      <td>&nbsp;<br />100</span><br />50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Three of a kind</strong><br />
        1 spot<br />
        2 spot<br />
        3 spot<br />
        4 spot<br />
        5 spot<br />
        6 spot
      </td>
      <td>&nbsp;<br />1,000<br />200<br />300<br />400<br />500<br />600</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Four of a kind<br />Five of a kind<br />Six of a kind<br /></strong></td>
      <td><em>2x three of a kind<br />4x three of a kind<br />8x three of a kind</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Straight</strong> (1-2-3-4-5-6)</td>
      <td>1,500</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Three pair</strong></td>
      <td>500</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  All scores above are for a single throw of the dice. For example, if
  the roller sets aside a single 1 spot and counts 100, and then on his
  next roll comes up with two 1 spots, he cannot count 1000 for three of
  a kind (he may set aside the additional as two single 1 spots for 200
  points).
</p>

<p>
  The first player who reaches a total of 10,000 means that the
  following round (after the current round) will be the last round. This
  allows his opponents at least one more attempt to reach 10,000. After
  that final round is finished, the player with the highest score is the
  winner of the game.
</p>

<p>
  In the event of a tie, the tying players will continue with full rounds until
  one player has a higher score than the other(s).
</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<p>
  It is better to leave yourself with three or more dice for a throw
  than it is to take single scoring dice. For instance, if you have set
  aside 2 dice already, and then throw two single scoring dice (say, a 1
  and a 5), then you should only take the single 1.
</p>

<p>
  If you are significantly behind, it is better to play aggressively
  than to play conservatively. Conversely, if you are significantly
  ahead, then it is better to play conservatively than aggressively. Some
  players are always aggressive or always conservative, but the adaptive
  player is the one most likely to win.
</p>

<p>
  Throwing all six dice will almost always lead to at least one
  scoring die. Only the ultra-conservative player will stop rolling with
  all six dice in their hand. An exception to this rule is the first
  round, since scoring the first round is much more difficult than
  subsequent rounds.
