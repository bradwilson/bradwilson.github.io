<h1>Game Rules <span class="fa fa-trophy"></span></h1>

<p>
  One of the best sets of memories I have of growing up is playing games with
  friends and family. Michigan has a strong card game playing history, and
  we also enjoyed board and video games. Here I've attempted to document the
  rules to some of my favorite games growing up.
