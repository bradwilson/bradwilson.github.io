<h1>Game Rules <span class="fa fa-trophy"></span></h1>

<p>
  One of the best sets of memories I have of growing up is playing games with
  friends and family. Michigan has a strong card game playing history, and
  we also enjoyed board and video games. Here I've attempted to document the
  rules to some of my favorite games growing up.
</p>

<h2>Euchre</h2>

<p>
  Euchre is a trick-taking game based on trump, using a partial deck of cards
  (typically 9 through Ace of the four suits). Card strength is by rank (10
  better than 9, Jack better than 10, etc.), with the trump suit beating the
  non-trump suits. There are two special cards called "bowers"&mdash;the Jack
  of the trump suit, and the Jack of the same color as the trump suit&mdash;which
  are the two most powerful cards, and both considered to be part of the trump
  suit.

  Players may or may not be working in partnership, depending on the variant of
  the game being played.
