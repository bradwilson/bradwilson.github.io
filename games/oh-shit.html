<h1>Oh Shit! <a href="."><span class="fa fa-trophy"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  A humorous variation on the classic card game Spades. You do not need to know
  how to play Spades to play this game.
</p>

<h2>Players</h2>

<p>3 to 8 players (5 or 6 is optimal)</p>

<h2>Cards</h2>

<p>One standard 52-card deck.</p>

<h2>Object</h2>

<p>
  Each hand results in points being scored (see "game play"). The object is to
  be the person with the most points at the end of the game.
</p>

<h2>Game play</h2>

<p>
  The game is played in a number of rounds. The number of round played depends
  on the number of players playing. The first round should start with each
  player getting the most cards possible from the deck (there may be left over
  cards; each player must get the same number of cards).
</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>
    If four players are playing, the first round starts with 13 cards each
    (52 / 4 = 13). There will be thirteen total rounds. Round two, each player
    will get 12 cards; round three, 11 cards; etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    If five players are playing, the first round starts with 10 cards each
    (52 / 5 = 10, with 2 extra cards). There will be ten total rounds. Round
    two, each player will get 9 cards; round three, 8 cards; etc.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Each hand starts with bidding. Starting with the player to the dealer's left,
  each player decides how many tricks they can take, given their hand. Spades
  are trump (meaning, spades always beat non-spades), and you must follow the
  suit played if you have it; if you do not have a card in the played suit, you
  may choose to play spades to take the trick, or you may play an off suit card.
</p>

<p>
  If you take the number of tricks you bid, you get 10 points plus your bid
  (so, if you bid 2, you get 12 points). You can bid zero if you don't think
  you can take any tricks. If you don't take the number of tricks you bid, you
  don't get any points.
</p>

<p>
  The total bids can not add up exactly to the number of available tricks. This
  is what gives this game it's colorful name -- someone will always end up not
  getting their bid. So for instance, if you have five cards in your hand and
  there are three players, and the first play bids 2 and the second player
  bids 1, then the third player must bid something <strong>besides</strong> 2
  (which would equal 5, the total number of available tricks).
</p>

<p>
  Play starts with the player to the left of the dealer. The winner of the trick
  begins the next trick. The hand is over when everyone is out of cards. Scores
  are marked, and the deal goes to the next player to the left of the last
  dealer.
</p>

<h2>Variants</h2>

<p>
  Sometimes, the game starts with 1 card and goes up rather than going down.
  Sometimes, instead of bidding one at a time, all players bid simultaneously
  (on the dealer's count of three); in this method, it is acceptable for the
  count to come out evenly, since nobody has any foreknowledge of what anyone
  else is bidding.
