<h1>Setback <a href="."><span class="fas fa-trophy"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  A variation on <a href="euchre.html">Euchre</a> and Pinochle. It may help to
  be familiar with the rules for Euchre before learning Setback.
</p>

<h2>Players</h2>

<p>4 (two teams, partners sit across from each other)</p>

<h2>Cards</h2>

<p>
  One euchre deck, plus 2s (or one full deck without the 3s-8s). The 6s are set
  aside for scoring.
</p>

<h2>Object</h2>

<p>The object of the game is to be the first team to score twelve points.</p>

<h2>Dealing</h2>

<p>
  Deal three cards at a time, twice around. When you're done dealing, you should
  be left with four cards. Place these cards off to the side, face down. You
  will not use them in the hand. <em>(note to Euchre players: resist the
  temptation to flip the top card!)</em>
</p>

<h2>Game play</h2>

<p>
  After dealing, the first player to the left of the dealer has the opportunity
  to bid for the number of points they'll take in that hand, or they can pass.
  Once you have passed, you cannot big any more. It continues on in a clockwise
  manner until someone has bid five, or everyone else has passed. The person who
  gets the bid names trump, and plays the first card.
</p>

<p>Hand points are taken in the following way:</p>

<ol>
  <li>having the highest trump card (usually the ace) in your hand</li>
  <li>having the lowest trump card (usually the deuce) in your hand</li>
  <li>capturing the jack of trump (right bower)</li>
  <li>capturing the jack of the same color as trump (left bower)</li>
  <li>capturing the most game points</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Setback players will often refer to these as "High, Low, Right, Left, Game"
  (sometimes saying "Double Jack" instead of "Right and Left"). Setback has
  bowers like Euchre, but they are in the middle of the deck rather than the
  highest cards.
</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>
    Hearts is trump. The jack of diamonds would be considered a heart for the
    purposes of suit. The value order of the hearts would be:
  </p>

  <p>
    A<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    K<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    Q<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    J<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    J<span class="suit diamond">♦</span>
    10<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    9<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
    2<span class="suit heart">♥</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    The other suits are normal order (diamonds would be missing the jack from
    its normal order, of course).
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Since the bowers aren't high cards, capturing them requires a little bit of
  care when playing. Also, since there are four left over cards that are not
  in play, it is possible for one (or both) of the bowers to be "buried", and
  thus only four (or three) hand points are available. Keep this in mind when
  bidding!
</p>

<p>
  Game points are counted based on the cards you take in during tricks. The
  values are as follows:
</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-nonfluid">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Card</th>
      <th>Game Points</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Ace</th>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>King</th>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Queen</th>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Jack</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Ten</th>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  There are eighty possible game points, so obviously, taking the tens are very
  important. In order to get the point for "game points", you must have at least
  forty one game points; if you tie with forty, then nobody gets the game point.
</p>

<p>
  Like Euchre, you must follow suit if you have it. However, unlike Euchre, you
  may play trump, even if you have the suit in question, to take the trick. So,
  you must follow suit, unless you play trump.
</p>

<p>
  The person who calls trump (the winning bidder) starts the first trick. The
  winner of each trick starts the next trick. The hand is over when all six
  tricks are played and collected.
</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>There are a possible five points available in each hand.</p>

<p>
  If you bid, and did not get your bid, then you go back the number of points
  you bid; otherwise, you get the number of hand points you collected. If you
  defended, you get the number of hand points you collected.
</p>
