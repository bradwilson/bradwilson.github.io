<h1 class="divider">Who is Brad?</h1>

<p>Hi! üëãüèº</p>
<p>
  I'm a software developer by trade, which I've been doing full time since 1993. I've lived and worked
  in many places in the United States, including Michigan (where I grew up), Massachusetts, Colorado,
  and Washington State where I reside now. I've visited all 50 states, and a dozen countries.
</p>
<p>
  I've worked on some things you may have heard of, like <a href="https://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> MVC,
  <a href="https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=entlib">Enterprise Library</a>, and
  <a href="https://archive.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>. I've done startups and big companies, and tend
  to like smaller teams. I currently work at <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> on internal
  developer tooling. I've also been involved in open source; I am the primary maintainer of
  <a href="https://xunit.net/">xUnit.net</a>, a unit testing framework for .NET developers (since 2007).
  I live stream <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/BradWilson72">on Twitch</a> usually once a week, working
  on the next version of xUnit.net.
</p>
<p>
  In my personal life, I am someone who consumes and occasionally produces music (mostly guitar, piano, and
  singing). I love playing games, especially board games, card games, and video games. I spend my outdoor time
  split between being on the water in a kayak or a raft, and on the road on my motorcycle.
</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
