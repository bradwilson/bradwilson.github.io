<h1 class="divider">Who is Brad?</h1>

<p>Hi! üëãüèº</p>
<p>
  I was a professional software developer from 1993 to 2022, though I've spent a lot of free time writing
  code, too. I've lived and worked in many places in the United States, including Michigan (where I grew up),
  Massachusetts, Colorado, and Washington State where I reside now. I've visited all 50 states, and a dozen
  countries.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the things I worked on, you've never heard of, because I spent a lot of time doing startups and
  small companies. I did have a couple stretches working on things you might've heard of, though:
  <a href="https://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> MVC and Dynamic Data,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Enterprise_Library">Enterprise Library</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodePlex">CodePlex</a>,
  <a href="https://appcenter.ms">Visual Studio App Center</a>, and most recently
  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. I've also been involved in open source; I am the primary maintainer of
  <a href="https://xunit.net/">xUnit.net</a>, a unit testing framework for .NET developers (since 2007).
  Mostly, though, I'm a lazy bum (aka, retired). It's pretty enjoyable.
</p>
<p>
  In my personal life, I am someone who consumes and occasionally produces music (mostly guitar, piano, and
  singing). I love playing games, especially board games, card games, and video games. I spend my outdoor time
  split between being on the water in a kayak or a raft, and on the road on my motorcycle.
</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
