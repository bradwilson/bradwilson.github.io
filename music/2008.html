<h1>Best Music of 2008 <a href="."><span class="fas fa-headphones"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  This was another great year for new rock &amp; metal music, just like 2007.
  I'm not sure if it's my tastes this year, or just the way schedules worked out,
  but almost everything on the list this year is really on the heavy side of rock
  (there is no analogue to Foo Fighters to hop into the mix this time around).
  A couple bands are missing because they have no videos (I'm looking at you, Ayreon)
  or the song they chose to make a video for is so mediocre (I'm looking at you,
  Metallica).
</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<h3>Opeth - Watershed</h3>

<p>
  In some ways, this album manages to eclipse Blackwater Park. It's a masterwork
  combination of their beautiful, acoustic harmonizing style and their brutal
  dark style.

<h3>Scar Symmetry - Holographic Universe</h3>

<p>
  Four albums in three years? Scar Symmetry are definitely one of my most favorite
  (and most productive) melodic death metal bands. Their vocal and musical hooks
  are gigantic, making me want to listen to their albums over and over again.

<h3>Trivium - Vengeance Falls</h3>

<p>
  What can I say? Trivium is probably my favorite thrash band right now, and this
  song really captures their style well.

<h3>The Human Abstract - Midheaven</h3>

<p>
  This was my favorite new discovery of the year; they have a very experimental
  prog rock sound and the video is very interesting (and very well done for a
  relatively obscure band).

<h3>Protest the Hero - Fortress</h3>

<p>
  You thought The Mars Volta were a little odd? These guys are like the insane
  little cousin to Mars Volta's normality.

<h3>In Flames - A Sense of Purpose</h3>

<p>
  I'm glad they chose this as the 2nd single for the album, because it is hands
  down the best on the disc. The hooks through the chorus are so big you could
  hang buffalo on them.

<h3>Testament - The Formation of Damnation</h3>

<p>
  They went 9 years without a new album, and it was well worth the wait. The new
  album effortlessly blends the heavy driving style of The Gathering with the
  melodic style of Practice What You Preach.
</p>

<h3>Meshuggah - obZen</h3>

<p>
  The drummer for Meshuggah is well known as being part drumming-robot, and this
  was the song that really caught people's attention for his style. Be warned
  that the video is kind of disturbing.
</p>

<h3>Evergrey - Torn</h3>

<p>
  These guys are one of the most under-appreciated metal bands... they put out
  album after album with just stellar material but I rarely see them get
  mentioned (maybe because nobody growls).
</p>

<h3>Disturbed - Indestructible</h3>

<p>
  The second video from their new album is for the war anthem "Indestructible",
  definitely one of my favorite songs on the disc. I find myself thrashing
  along in the car whenever it's in the rotation.

<h3>Slipknot - All Hope Is Gone</h3>

<p>
  I'd never listened to Slipknot before I saw this video on Headbanger's Ball a
  couple weeks before the album's release. I always thought them to be a bit
  gimmicky, but this song really kicks ass.
</p>

<h3>DevilDriver - The Last Kind Words</h3>

<p>
  I ended up watching this one because of the interesting video, and when I listened
  to the whole album with my Zune Pass, decided it was a keeper. (And, no, the kids
  aren't the band.)
