<h1>Best Music of 2011 <a href="."><span class="fa fa-headphones"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  Time for the annual "best of" blog post, and this year was packed full of more
  great music than I can ever remember.
</p>

<p>
  I flirted with buying my music only online this year, but have since switched
  back to CDs, so that I can rip everything in lossless. Automatic down-conversion
  to the phone is great, and I can still keep my lossless audio streams for the
  house, and all it costs is disk space (for my complete music collection, that's
  roughly 1TB). This is also the year I dumped my Zune Pass, and tried (but failed
  to be captivated by) Spotify.
</p>

<h2>Genre: Alternative</h2>

<h3>R.E.M. - Collapse into Now</h3>

<p>
  2011 is the year that R.E.M. released its first truly great album in probably
  a decade... and then promptly broke up. Good jorb, guys.
</p>

<h2>Genre: Metal</h2>

<h3>Anthrax - Worship Music</h3>

<p>
  Against all odds, Anthrax is back, and with Joey back at lead vocals. Worship
  Music is a great throwback to the classic 'thrax of olden days.
</p>

<h3>Iced Earth - Dystopia</h3>

<p>
  I had more or less written off Iced Earth as being uninteresting. There was the
  flirtation with Tim "Ripper" Owens that yielded one great album and a bunch of
  meh. Then they went back to long-time singer Matt Barlow, but he didn't seem
  to have the heart, and was gone after one album. Now they've found another
  (their 5th?) in Stu Block, and his vocal style honestly combines the best of
  Barlow and Ripper, and the music feels emotionally inspired again.
  Welcome back, guys!

<h3>Mastodon - The Hunter</h3>

<p>
  Mastodon's last album was a mixed bag: some thought it was the best of their
  career, and some thought it the worst. I definitely found myself in the former
  camp, and I think The Czar remains some of the best stuff they've ever done.
  This new album is quite good, though not quite up to the standards of the last
  album. It feels less progressive and more conventional.
</p>

<h3>Megadeth - Th1rt3en</h3>

<p>
  Megadeth have always been a more consistent band than Metallica for metal fans
  (Risk notwithstanding), and their 13th studio album still delivers the fire
  from the old days.
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qHMUyHZi440?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Symphony X - Iconoclast</h3>

<p>
  A new SymX disc is always cause for celebration. Russell Allen has one of the
  greatest voices in metal (now that Dio is no longer with us), and their
  symphonic/power metal prowess is, as always, honed to a very fine edge.
</p>

<h3>Within Temptation - The Unforgiven</h3>

<p>
  I'm a sucker for concept albums and for female metal singers, so this was a
  double dose for me. It's a little pop-ish for some metal fans' tastes, but
  Sharon den Andel is always great to listen, because she tends to have a more
  reserved style than many other female metal singers. The bonus videos with
  the album were an excellent treat!
</p>

<h2>Genre: Extreme Metal</h2>

<h3>Amon Amarth - Surtur Rising</h3>

<p>
  I'm a latecomer to Amon Amarth (and extreme metal in general), so while others
  didn't really think much of Twilight of the Thunder Gods, I liked it quite a
  lot. Surtur Rising is superior in pretty much every important way, and is a
  regular player even many months after its release.
</p>

<h3>Arch Enemy - Khaos Legions</h3>

<p>
  Another refinement in the melodic death metal machinery of Arch Enemy... yes,
  it's different than the old material, but it's pretty great in its own right.
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hBLugrlPZ2U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Between the Buried and Me - The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues</h3>

<p>
  Calling this "just a three song EP" downplays the masterful music that spans
  nearly 30 minutes, almost long enough to be considered an album were this 20
  years ago. Just whets the appetite for the next full length album...
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GE8zQEShT7w?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>The Black Dahlia Murder - Ritual</h3>

<p>
  There isn't a lot of metal coming out of my home town of Detroit these days,
  but TBDM more than make up for it with some seriously brutal yet brilliantly
  melodic metal.
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yDEvqdw2fmA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Fleshgod Apocalypse - Agony</h3>

<p>
  I'd never heard of these guys before hanging out on Turntable.fm, so imagine
  my surprise at the unbelievable combination of technical death metal and orchestral
  arrangements that awaited me. The talent in this band, especially the drummer,
  is nearly inhuman.
</p>

<h3>Ghost Brigade - Until Fear No Longer Defines Us</h3>

<p>Listening to this album Every. Single. Day. 'nuff said.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6kubmMxykI8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Insomnium - One for Sorrow</h3>

<p>
  Insomnium are yet another one of those quiet, competent ass-kicking melodic
  death metal bands that doesn't ever quite get the recognition it deserves.
  Another fine outing!
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ns9_A3CKqPM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Obscura - Omnivium</h3>

<p>
  Ever since Metallica started opening their albums with acoustic, classical-inspired
  snippets, I've had a fondness for the unexpected during those first 60 seconds
  of the album. Obscura hit it out of the park with this opener!
</p>

<h3>Omnium Gatherum - New World Shadows</h3>

<p>
  This is my first album from the Finnish melodic death metal band, but it definitely
  won't be my last. Soul Journeys is probably one of the best melodeath songs
  of the year.
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/42qbzF_ektM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Opeth - Heritage</h3>

<p>
  Mikael disappointed a lot of long-time fans when he announced that Opeth's newest
  album would not only be all clean vocals, but a rather stark musical departure
  at that. More inspired by 70's fusion jazz and progressive rock than modern
  metal, it really hits a sweet spot for me. The whole album is audible candy.
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FxvN_GxgpF8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Scar Symmetry - The Unseen Empire</h3>

<p>
  When Christian left Scar Symmetry, many fans were shocked that they replaced
  him with not one but two vocalists. Although both can sing and growl, each has
  their stronger suits. The resulting first album was Dark Matter Dimensions,
  and most long-time fans thought it was probably the end of old SS. The Unseen
  Empire proved that they just need to get back on creative track.
</p>

<h2>Genre: Progressive Rock/Metal</h2>

<h3>Andromeda - Manifest Tyranny</h3>

<p>
  I've always been a pretty big fan of Andromeda's mix of prog metal and futuristic
  sounds and topics. This new album definitely steps up the pace quite a bit at
  times, especially the opening track.
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uiSaakTpZ-o?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Arch/Matheos - Sympathetic Resonance</h3>

<p>
  This is probably metal heresy, but there's something very Queensrÿche-ian about
  Arch/Matheos, which is to say that it reminds of the glimpse of the greatness
  that Operation: Mindcrime convinced us Queensrÿche had inside, but couldn't
  quite deliver on reliably. Arch/Matheos have no such problems.
</p>

<h3>Dream Theater - A Dramatic Turn of Events</h3>

<p>
  With no small amount of irony did Dream Theater choose the name of their latest
  album. This year saw the band lose one of its founding members (and musical
  backbone) in Mike Portnoy. DT decided to keep moving forward and hired Mike
  Mangini, and turned the audition and hiring process into a three part YouTube
  series. Just as importantly, they created some of the most solid material
  in more than a decade.
</p>

<h3>Evergrey - Glorious Collision</h3>

<p>
  Evergrey are like the Little Prog Metal Band That Could. They keep soldiering
  on in undeserved obscurity, turning out album after album of incredibly
  solid music.
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DQcJuzMwGc0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Protest the Hero - Scurrilous</h3>

<p>
  This is PtH's most commercially acceptable release, which is still a long damn
  way from what other bands might call "selling out". The undertone of crazy
  is still here, though.
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vKZ-eKBJ9dw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Steven Wilson - Grace for Drowning</h3>

<p>
  Steven Wilson is the brains behind Porcupine Tree, and a long-time musical
  collaborator with Mikael and the boys in Opeth. His solo work tends to be
  more experimental and atmospheric than Porcupine Tree.
</p>

<h3>TesseracT - One</h3>

<p>
  One of the most refined and unique sounds in progressive metal today, TesseracT
  were an obvious immediate addiction to me.
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JF_YIiRoRFM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Textures - Dualism</h3>

<p>Textures blends a bit of progressive metal, and occasional metalcore and djent tendencies.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mcIliX_z_7M?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h2>Genre: Soundtrack</h2>

<h3>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</h3>

<p>
  Trent Reznor seems to have diverted his career into soundtracks, and with great
  success. Last year his big success was The Social Network; this year, he succeeds
  well with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. The opening credits have this quite
  good cover of Led Zeppelin serving as the audio backdrop.
</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fkP3urtYCkc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Tron: Legacy Reconfigured</h3>

<p>
  Technically, the original soundtrack came out last year with the movie, but
  there was a remix CD released this year. The most shocking thing about it is
  how much better it is than the original, which I would've said was one of the
  best soundtracks released in many years.
