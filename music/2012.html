<h1>Best Music of 2012 <a href="."><span class="fas fa-headphones"></span></a></h1>

<p>I bought a lot of music this year.</p>

<p>
  My collection contains 65 albums from 2012 alone, and that doesn't count the
  many more than supplemented my collection from years gone by. Pretty much every
  album I bought this year had something of value on it, and I can't realistically
  embed 65 albums worth of videos on this page, so this year I'm going to continue
  with the genre categorization, but only offer videos from select artists
  (new &amp; notable).
</p>

<p>
  This year, I finished my desire to re-rip everything into lossless, and continue
  to buy physical media almost exclusively (primarily CD, but also occasional
  Blu-ray discs, which seem to have replaced DVD-Audio and SACD as the mechanism
  for delivering 5.1 lossless audio). It's really a shame that there are no good
  places to buy lossless online at reasonable prices; the content on sites like
  <a href="https://www.hdtracks.com/">HDtracks</a> is extremely limited and expensive.

<h2>Genre: Hard Rock &amp; Metal</h2>

<h3>Brendon Small - Galaktikon</h3>

<p>
  Brendon is the multi-instrumentalist brains behind several acclaimed animated
  TV shows, including Metalocalypse (which birthed his Dethklok project). Galaktikon
  is a side project grown simply from his desire to do a "high-stakes, intergalactic
  rock album". As always, he creates new paths, and we follow happily.

<h3>Devin Townsend Project - Epicloud</h3>

<p>
  I'd known of Devin Townsend ("Hevy Devy") as the hyperactive singer from Strapping
  Young Lad, as well as the signer from Steve Vai's short-lived stint at including
  vocals on his albums. This was the first solo album I'd picked up, and ended up
  back-filling the whole catalog of his solo work within weeks of acquiring this.

<h3>Kiss - Monster</h3>

<p>
  Yes, modern Kiss records have left a lot to be desired, especially their last
  outing, Sonic Boom. To me, this album sounds like a heavy dose of Revenge,
  peppered with the old style ala Love Gun or Destroyer.
</p>

<h3>Lacuna Coil - Dark Adrenaline</h3>

<p>
  Every album from Lacuna Coil tips the scales a little heavier, and with each
  also comes a more comfortable style. With both a male and female vocalist,
  they are fairly unique, and the songs on Dark Adrenaline finally feel like
  they are balanced just as they should be between the two.

<h3>Sonata Arctica - Stones Grow Her Name</h3>

<p>
  This album, more than any in its career, finds Sonata Arctica in razor sharp focus.
  Previous albums have been between "okay" and "very good", but this is one of
  first ones that I'd call truly "great" in quite a while.

<h2>Genre: Extreme Metal</h2>

<h3>Allegaeon - Formshifter</h3>

<p>
  It's hard to believe that this band has only two albums, as they are unquestionably
  the absolute kings of technical melodic death metal. The twin attack of the 8-string
  guitars is relentlessly accurate. This was (and still is) my most listened-to
  album of the year.
</p>

<h3>Before the Dawn - Rise of the Phoenix</h3>

<p>
  I discovered this band this year (via my friend <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/">Peter</a>),
  and it was a stellar find. I picked up an older album as well, but it didn't
  quite have the staying power than Rise of the Phoenix has with me. I know that
  when I pick this album on the iPod in the car, it's going to make it through
  several rotations before being replaced.

<h3>Between the Buried &amp; Me - The Parallax II: Future Sequence</h3>

<p>
  The album Colors has long been my favorite BTBAM album... until this year.
  This album, a follow-up to their 40-minute 3-song "EP" last year, has definitely
  topped the favorite list for me now, at least partly because I'm a sucker
  for concept albums.
</p>

<h3>Stealing Axion - Moments</h3>

<p>
  This is the first album for Stealing Axion, encapsulating (in better quality)
  the 5 song EP from two years ago, plus several new songs. I expect lots more
  goodness from them in the future.
</p>

<h3>Woods of Ypress - Woods V: Grey Skies &amp; Electric Light</h3>

<p>
  Lead vocalist David Gold passed away shortly after the band finished recording
  this album. Given that he was the primary driving creative force, this will be
  the last Woods album... but what a gift he left us.

</p>

<h2>Genre: Progressive</h2>

<h3>Coheed &amp; Cambria - The Afterman: Ascension</h3>

<p>
  Coheed &amp; Cambria continue to release albums telling the story of The Amory
  Wars. The Afterman is a two-part release; Ascension was released in 2012, and
  Descension will be released in 2013. This is Coheed's best album since 2005's
  'From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness', and a worthy addition to the
  Amory canon.

<h3>Katatonia - Dead End Kings</h3>

<p>
  A few albums ago, Katatonia converted from an extreme metal band to a prog metal
  band. Many of the core followers lament this transition, but I absolutely
  believe that they are making the best music of their careers right now.
</p>

<h3>Storm Corrosion - Storm Corrosion</h3>

<p>
  The progressive rock collaboration between Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson and
  Opeth's Mikael Ã…kerfeldt couldn't possibly have made me happier. This was a
  pairing that was decades in the making, and represents the pinnacle of modern
  prog. Besides, how can you not love a album with three 10-minute songs on it? :)

<h4>Other notable releases:</h4>
<p>
  Cynic - The Portal Tapes<br />
  The Mars Volta - Noctourniquet<br />
  Rush - Clockwork Angels

<h2>Genre: Everything Else</h2>

<h3>David Guetta - Nothing but the Beat (the Electronic Album)</h3>

<p>
  I'm particular with my electronica, but this find (via
  <a href="http://www.osbornm.com/">Matthew</a>) is quite the gem.
</p>

<p><iframe class="youtube" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vzE8d5AXImo?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>deadmau5 - &gt; Album Title Goes Here &lt;</h3>

<p>
  I got hooked by the somewhat atypical hit The Veldt, and then back-filled my
  collection with the last 4 albums. It's all terrific stuff, but this song is
  really spectacular.
</p>

<h3>Garbage - Not Your Kind of People</h3>

<p>
  A change of style and attitude was exactly what Garbage needed, as it produced
  their best album since their first album 17 years ago.
</p>

<p><iframe class="youtube" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4OdTBCgqRt4?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Swedish House Mafia - Until Now</h3>

<p>
  Sad that I've just made this discovery, since the now 4 year old band has broken
  up. Thanks a lot, Matthew. :-p
