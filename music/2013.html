<h1>Best Music of 2013</h1>

<p>It was another banner year for music.</p>

<p>
  My collection this year contains 55 albums from 2013, and my love of lossless
  audio continues unabated. The collection of new music covers 8 major genres
  (plus comedy, where 3 albums land). Progressive continues to top my musical
  interest list, followed closely by traditional and extreme metal. This year
  I added a substantial amount of music in the pop/electronic area, including
  back-filling a bunch of long-lost or new-to-me music from years gone by.
</p>

<p>Let's dig in.</p>

<h2>Genre: Pop &amp; Electronic</h2>

<h3>Daft Punk - Random Access Memories</h3>

<p>
  Not counting soundtracks and live albums, it's been a decade since Daft Punk
  released anything... and, realistically, their 2001 album Discovery is probably
  what they're best known for. It's surprising, then, how dramatically they changed
  the formula for Random Access Memories: it reads like it's lifted straight from
  the 70's rock playbook. The guest musicians really lent a great new style infusion
  on this record. While Get Lucky with Farrell Williams was the big hit, I much
  preferred the opening track.

<h3>Armin Van Buuren - Intense</h3>

<p>
  The team room (via <a href="http://osbornm.com/" target="_self">Matthew</a>) at
  work introduced me to Armin Van Buuren, and I immediately bought a big chunk of
  the back catalog. His albums "A State of Trance" are less a collection of songs
  and more albums full of constant musical transitions, whereas his personal albums
  feel more like individual songs. The collaborations are excellent mental coding
  fuel.

<h3>Kaskade - Atmosphere</h3>

<p>
  Yet another one introduced to me by Matthew, this tends a little bit more towards
  the pure pop side but still offering a decent dose of the electronic feel that
  keeps me interested.

<h2>Genre: Progressive</h2>

<h3>Dream Theater</h3>

<p>
  I was one of the many Dream Theater fans that was disappointed to learn of Mike
  Portnoy's departure from the band. Their first album with new drummer Mike Mangini
  was good but somewhat unremarkable. Their latest self-titled album dispelled the
  fears that A Dramatic Turn of Events had left me with, thinking that their best
  years were behind them. Far from it, this new album is their best in more than a
  decade for sure; Mangini proves is not only up to the task of time keeper, but
  in many ways, his writing surpasses the later work of Portnoy.

<h3>Queensr每che</h3>

<p>
  Queensr每che had a very public splitting in two during 2012, with founder and
  lead singer Geoff Tate separating from the organization to form a new band
  named... Queensr每che. Yes, there are two Queensr每che albums released this year,
  and the Tate affair (Frequency Unknown) was -- in no uncertain terms -- a musical
  turd. The rest of the band teamed up with Todd La Torra to release their second
  self-titled album, a much more interesting and relevant record. With track titles
  like "Redemption", "Vindication", and "Don't Look Back", it's hard to miss
  the animosity. :)

<h3>Steven Wilson - The Raven That Refused to Sing</h3>

<p>
  Porcupine Tree front man Steven Wilson has released his second full length solo
  album, and it's sonic delight, as you'd expect. The opening track literally had
  my jaw on the floor during the first listen as it melded 70's prog rock, jazz
  and modern rock... and then the flute kicked in. Just... wow.
</p>

<h3>TesseracT - Altered State</h3>

<p>
  I continue to remain enthralled with the unpredictable, beautiful sounds of
  TesseracT, the British band that effortlessly merges ethereal style and modern
  prog metal.

<h2>Genre: Metal</h2>

<h3>Fleshgod Apocalypse - Labyrinth</h3>

<p>
  It's almost impossible to anticipate and appreciate the impact of what it means
  to combine brutal technical death metal with orchestral arrangements. This album,
  unlike most of those in my favorites list for the year, is extremely situational;
  I can't just put it on any time and expect to enjoy it. When those moments are
  right, though, there's literally nothing like it in the world.

<h3>Ashes of Ares</h3>

<p>
  Former Iced Earth vocalist Matt Barlow has landed in a new band. If you're
  looking for something to supplement the heavy metal classics of the 90's, this
  is definitely the album you've been waiting for.

<h3>Amon Amarth - Deceiver of the Gods</h3>

<p>
  Let's be honest: Viking Death Metal is pretty niche-y. So how is that every Amon
  Amarth album, despite having the same fundamental building blocks, ends up sounding
  fresh and interesting? Mystery of the universe, and my ears are the happy recipients.

<h2>Genre: Rock &amp; Folk</h2>

<h3>Alter Bridge - Fortress</h3>

<p>
  On the surface, there's a lot to dislike about a band whose inevitable description
  has to start with "It's like Creed, but...", except that the devil's in the
  details. Swapping out dufus Scott Stapp for vocal gymnast Myles Kennedy, and
  writing that's excellent, leaves you with a band that's just plain enjoyable
  as a dirty little secret.

<h3>Dave Grohl - Sound City</h3>

<p>
  Foo Fighters front man and former Nirvana member is known for musical collaborations.
  His metal album Probot was an absolute favorite of mine. When I heard he was
  teaming up with some rock's biggest super stars, I knew it would be magical...
  and truth is, even that didn't prepare the world for how amazing the album is.
  Drink in this beautiful Stevie Nicks vehicle with Taylor Hawkins in attendance.

<h3>Blake Noble - Underdog</h3>

<p>
  I stumbled across Blake Noble on Kickstarter. I was looking for things to sponso
  from local Seattle-area projects, and I was entranced by this Australian transplant's
  music. I immediately sponsored the album and was not in the least disappointed
  with the result. This is a fantastic blending of world folk and just down
  home rock grooves.
