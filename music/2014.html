<h1>Best Music of 2014 <a href="."><span class="fas fa-headphones"></span></a></h1>

<p>Here we are again, for the 8th time.</p>

<p>
  I bought a lot less music this year than in previous years. Wait, scratch that.
  I bought a lot less <i>"released this year"</i> new music this year than in
  previous years. In 2011, I bought 88 albums from 2011; in 2012, 82 albums;
  and in 2013, 63 albums. This year, I've only bought 39 new albums. I'll admit,
  this was a bit of surprise for me, because this year seems like it contained
  just as much good new music as previous years. Maybe I'm getting picky in my
  old age. ;)
</p>

<h2>Genre: Alternative</h2>

<h3>Tori Amos - Unrepentant Geraldines</h3>

<p>
  When she burst onto the scene, Tori Amos was unrelenting and unrepentant. Little
  Earthquakes remains to this day one of my favorite alternative albums of all time.
  'll admit that she had fallen by the wayside for me, as the last album of hers
  that really gripped me was 2001's Strange Little Girls. I happened across a
  track from the new album when getting this year's HD Tracks Sampler, and I am
  certainly glad to have her back in the rotation. The music is mostly stripped
  back down to basics, which is when Tori is at her best.

<h2>Genre: Pop &amp; Electronic</h2>

<h3>Calvin Harris - Motion</h3>

<p>
  The new album from Scottish mega-star DJ Calvin Harris is a massive collaborative
  effort featuring songs from just about every sub-genre of pop and electronic
  music. For that reason, it's hard to pick a favorite, so I'm going to cheat and
  pick two: the up-tempo pop song Outside (with vocals by Ellie Goulding) and the
  throbbing house instrumental Slow Acid. Warm up your sub-woofer.

<h3>The Crystal Method</h3>

<p>
  A dub-step inspired Crystal Method song is the last place I would've expected
  to find folk singer Dia Frampton (runner up from the first season of The Voice),
  but the song actually works well with her voice. Just a fair warning that the
  video might be unsafe for work. :)

<h3>deadmau5 - while(1 &lt; 2)</h3>

<p>
  A new deadmau5 album is always cause for celebration, and this double album more
  than delivered. The collaborations with Trent Reznor (both as Nine Inch Nails and
  as How To Destroy Angels) are both highlights of the album, but my hands down
  favorite is My Pet Coelacanth features only a single lyric, occasionally shouted,
  with one of the best beats (and bridge) he's ever put down.

<h3>Pentatonix - PTX, Vol. III</h3>

<p>
  Most acts on The Sing Off (an a capela singing contest) have many people, so
  when Pentatonix showed up with just 5, it was an astonishing thing to watch.
  They vaulted their 3rd season victory into massive YouTube success -- three
  quarters of a billion video views -- and then a full fledged touring and
  album-releasing career.

<h3>Skrillex - Recess</h3>

<p>
  I'll be honest: this is the first Skillex album that I didn't mostly hate. It
  has a couple songs on it that I'm not too fond of, but there are some really
  great songs in there. I don't know if you'd attribute that to his growth as
  an artist, or just a simple shift onto my radar, but it makes me happy
  either way. :)

<h2>Genre: Progressive</h2>

<h3>Animals as Leaders - The Joy of Motion</h3>

<p>
  <i>Insanely</i> is the single best adverb for Animals as Leaders: insanely
  talented, insanely complex, and insanely entertaining. The instrumental
  wunderkinds are back again, and listening to their creations makes me...
  insanely happy.
</p>

<h3>Opeth - Pale Communion</h3>

<p>
  Their transition to straight-up progressive rock band began in earnest with
  2011's Heritage, which saw them shed the death metal vocals in favor of pure
  clean vocals from lead singer and mastermind Mikael Åkerfeldt. Whereas Heritage
  still held onto the metal edges from their past, there's no way to hide the
  fact that Pale Communion is like a love letter to 1970's prog bands (the song
  Goblin sounds like it could've been written by the band of the same name).
</p>

<p>
  Let me be clear: this is a top 10 progressive rock album; of all time, not just
  2014. I put it up there with Rush's 2112, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon,
  King Crimson's In The Court of the Crimson King, Genesis' Lamb Lies Down on
  Broadway, or anything from modern bands like Porcupine Tree and Dream Theater.
  For that reason, you get two tracks.

<h2>Genre: Metal</h2>

<h3>Agalloch - The Serpent &amp; The Sphere</h3>

<p>
  The masters of atmosphere black metal released what is my favorite album of
  their since 2005's The Mantle. The mostly muted vocals just add to the creepy,
  ethereal effect on Celestial Effigy.
</p>

<h3>Allegaeon - Elements of the Infinite</h3>

<p>
  Colorado natives Allegaeon are a band that can do no wrong in my mind. In the
  short time they've been together (their first full length album was released
  just 4 years ago), they have absolutely become one of my favorite death metal
  bands of all time. Their technical style is amazing, and I'm convinced their
  drummer Brandon Park is part cyborg. The video for 1.618 pokes fun at
  themselves, first and foremost, and also at the obsession of metal fans to
  minutely categorize all forms of metal music. CRABCORE 4 LIFE!
</p>

<h3>Ghost Brigade - IV - One with the Storm</h3>

<p>
  I almost missed this release this year, but it arrived at my house just in time.
  I've been a huge fan of Ghost Brigade after my first listen to "Until Fear No
  Longer Defines Us". Their blend of melodies with both brutal and harmonized
  vocals is just something special. The new album was not a disappointment:
  an exquisite blend of everything that makes them great.

<h3>Iced Earth - Plagues of Babylon</h3>

<p>
  Stu Block joined Iced Earth for 2011's Dystopia, replacing on-again off-again
  vocalist Matt Barlow (who moved on to Ashes of Ares). Interestingly, Stu's
  voice is capable of giving good rendition to both Barlow's baritone and Tim
  Owens' high-reaching tenor, so he has an incredible range (in addition to
  being able to perform almost all of their back catalog live in concert).
  Whereas Dystopia felt a little disjointed, Babylon feels like Stu has been
  really solidly integrated into the writing process. My favorite track is
  Among the Living Dead, featuring long time collaborator and Blind Guardian
  lead singer Hansi Kürsch.

<h3>Mastodon - Once More 'round The Sun</h3>

<p>
  Role-playing with grandma? LARPing with strangers in the park? There's no way
  this video wasn't being part of the collection this year. :)
</p>

<h3>Scar Symmetry - The Singularity (Phase 1: Neohumanity)</h3>

<p>
  Swedish melodic death metal masters Scar Symmetry are known for telling sci-fi
  stories of far future, post-apocalyptic humanity. This year they announced
  they would be releasing a trilogy of albums call The Singularity, focused on
  the subject of transhumanism, and that the first phase album Neohumanity would
  be released before the end of the year. Using a word like transcendent to
  describe the album sounds like hyperbole, but this is far and away the best
  work they've done. I can't wait for the next two albums.
</p>

<h3>Wovenwar</h3>

<p>
  I always found As I Lay Dying to be a band whose sound fatigued me: not quite
  enough melody, too much repetition, and vocals that were primarily undifferentiated
  screaming. When AILD's lead singer was arrested, the band decided to move on
  with a new singer and a new name. Wovenwar's slight tweaking of the AILD formula
  really turned this on its head for me, and the result is an extremely enjoyable,
  straight ahead American-style heavy metal album.
