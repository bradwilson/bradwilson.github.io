<h1>Best Music of 2016 <a href="."><span class="fa fa-headphones"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  Although this is only my second time doing the Top 5 format, I must say that
  it was nearly impossible to prune the list this year. An unexpected result is
  that there is not a single growled-vocal band in the top 5 (not for lack of
  trying: Fleshgod Apocalypse, Obscura, and Alleageon just missed making the list).
  Make sure you dig into the honorable mentions this year for more fantastic music.

<h2>Top 5 albums of the year</h2>

<h3>#5: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Qt9TtwtjnyAhnrsf432ctJ_1fu1ghTX">Sorceress</a></strong> by Opeth</h3>

<p>
  Opeth have fully made their transition from melodic death metal to progressive rock.
  This year's Sorceress has moments that can be described as heavy, but there are no real
  metal roots left in the music. Instead, we're treated to some absolutely sublime moments
  (including Will 'o the Wisp, embeded below). In some ways, Sorceress didn't quite grip me
  as fully as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx9v5BShGkFgcras-oojyjf7Z5Lym93YT">Pale Communion</a>
  did, my hands-down favorite album of 2014.

<h3>#4: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-I91CUhz4mhHyTz5p3rrqVtUEwYbTFyD">You Want it Darker</a></strong> by Leonard Cohen</h3>

<p>
  2016 will go down as the year that took some of our most beloved musicians.
  I think the loss of Leonard Cohen was something I felt most personally. Like
  David Bowie, he managed to craft a knowing departure album; to me, this may be
  the best album Cohen has ever penned. As the title suggests, it's dark and it's
  personal. He claimed he would
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RciOCn_Nmh0">live forever</a>, and
  while his body may have failed, he surely will live forever in the hearts of
  his countless fans.

<h3>#3: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnmUN1_SPLFWzDECCGEIuXdKwBJfDDhON">The Madness of Many</a></strong> by Animals as Leaders</h3>

<p>
  Animals as Leaders is a nearly one-of-a-kind band today: a fusion of a dozen
  genres, rooted in guitar-centered rock. They had a little success with earlier
  albums, but their latest yielded no actual videos (only audio tracks from their
  label). Nevermind that, though: the skills on display here are mind blowing.
  The easiest way to explain it would probably be: imagine a guitarist of the
  skill of Joe Satriani or Steve Vai, except the whole band is that good. These
  musical masterpieces do not need vocals.

<h3>#2: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlnCtjJmI4FrW5ig0nMrC_tFr4fxYpBWk">Here</a></strong> by Alicia Keys</h3>

<p>
  Alicia's freshman outing
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDZhhaQpu27AXbpfdzxXOCjtEB5Vo5rOm">Songs in A Minor</a>
  remains one of my favorite R&amp;B albums of all time, one of the few that I
  bought in DVD-Audio so I could wrap myself in the wonderful 5.1 mix). With her
  recent stint as a judge on NBC's The Voice, a whole new generation is getting
  to appreciate her exquisite talent. Here is a terrific listen from start to finish,
  effortlessly blending R&amp;B, hip-hop, and classical.

<h3>#1: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeOVmzupi5NzlKeNMF0n2Yn1pkdYTrhhd">Dystopia</a></strong> by Megadeth</h3>

<p>
  A lot was made this year about the return of Metallica. That's what happens when you
  put out a record every 6 or 7 years. For the amount of time we waited, it wasn't particularly
  overwhelming. Megadeth, on the other hand, have been putting out record after record
  of extremely solid, old-school heavy metal, and Dystopia is a phenomenal addition
  to their catalog. With a title like Dystopia, you know Mustaine is going to be at his
  political, post-apocalyptic peak. It's difficult for me to rank their albums;
  that said, this is their most enjoyable album since Rust in Peace. Yeah, it's #1-spot good. :)
