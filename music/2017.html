<h1>Best Music of 2017 <a href="."><span class="fa fa-headphones"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  I couldn't do it. No matter how hard I tried, I simply couldn't prune the list to just five
  albums that deserved to be highlighted. You'll have to forgive the indulgence. This year was simply
  packed front to back with great albums. Even stopping at 7 was a concession.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, this year I've added <a href="2017-headphones">headphone recommendations</a>. This is
  not likely to be an annual thing, as the technology here generally doesn't change quickly.
</p>


<h2>Top 7 albums of the year</h2>

<h3>#7: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOrTlMbJrSXi259kGIHnYZaKbxpaiuMb_">Apex</a></strong> by Unleash the Archers</h3>

<p>
  Power metal bands have a tendency to be self-mocking: cringe inducing lyrics and sketchy song writing.
  Unleash the Archers are the real deal, my favorite power metal discovery since Symphony X (who they faintly
  remind me of). Everybody in the band has excellent skills; the craft amazingly well-built songs buoyed by
  the soaring voice of Brittney Slayes. Of course the (other) videos will have the inevitable face paint, bonfires,
  and ancient weapons, but it still just makes me smile and bang my head. Great album.

<h3>#6: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd-eI_-Iuk-GVnj4P1zpN76BCLL0UZrW9">Emperor of Sand</a></strong> by Mastodon</h3>

<p>
  Level setting: Every Mastodon album is <em>great</em>, and some of them are <em>fucking amazing</em>. This is one
  of the former. A great Mastodon album is better than almost anything else that gets released, but this lands at
  #6 because there are so many worthy, perfected performances this year. Gloriously large soundscapes are present,
  vocals are to die for, crazy time-changing riffs to entertain...but you already know all of this. This is
  <em>great</em> Mastodon. Go ahead and revel in it.

<h3>#5: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeYPW6Xt44gBy6H4BAo8VFNsW_Eg80oVX">Lykaia</a></strong> by Soen</h3>

<p>
  Described as a progressive metal superband, Soen's members hail from bands like Opeth, Death, Testament, and Willowtree.
  The album suffers from mediocre production quality (as do previous recordings). That's a shame because it's some of the
  best laid down prog metal in a year which includes great albums from the likes of Caligula's Horse, QotSA, The Contortionist,
  The Great Discord, and Threshold. The vocals are smooth and powerful, the harmonies excellently executed, and the melodies
  are stuffed full of great hooks and impactful riffs. It's one of those albums that begs to be listened to over and over
  again until you just can't stand it anymore...except that moment never really comes.

<h3>#4: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv16fXg2izkqBFv6L2TUHszVhcsZ-UeX2">Everybody</a></strong> by Logic</h3>

<p>
  This was a really good year for rap music. Logic crafted something better to my ears than Jay-Z and Macklemore, which should
  only be shocking to someone who's new to his music. The song "1-800-273-8255" was a huge hit this year, and for good reason:
  it was an excellent collaboration with an important message, terrific music, emotional punch, and an
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb24RrHIbFk">amazing star-studded video</a>. That's not the sum total of the experience,
  though: the album is chock full of variety, fun &amp; anger, tremendous musicality, sick beats, plus several appearances by
  Neil deGrasse Tyson as God. In short: Logic perfected.

<h3>#3: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLArAJlC1y55_2FB9uPO9uAFXTM-TPkQXn">Urn</a></strong> by Ne Obliviscaris</h3>

<p>
  Ne Obliviscaris is a new-to-me band that I discovered after watching the
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw97EVMVWlQ">Lost in Vegas</a> reaction video for "And Plague Flowers
  the Kaleidoscope" from an older album. I was blown away by their
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuVdsx7qJY">live performance</a> and decided to pick up that album
  (Portal of I) as well as 2017's Urn. I really don't know how to categorize the music: what do you call a band
  that's part new age and part extreme metal? I will "forget not", and it's definitely worthy of the list this year.

<h3>#2: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5cdZ6TNsONlrpYBp_PzeOLpMHS0fyXL4">E</a></strong> by Enslaved</h3>

<p>
  With an almost parallel history (and many more albums), it's easiest/laziest to describe Norway's Enslaved
  to new listeners as the black metal version of Sweden's Opeth: they both started with a more or less
  pure take on their genres (black and death metal, respectively), and over time they've added progressive
  elements to the music. To my ear, "E" is to Enslaved as "Ghost Reveries" is to Opeth: the perfect blend
  of progressive elements and core style that's bound to be my go-to favorite for many years to come. (I
  seriously doubt Enslaved will follow Opeth into a pure progressive rock transformation. ðŸ˜‰) This album
  is full of lush backgrounds, layered with a combination of clean and black vocals; it's definitely more
  progressive and hook-filled than black metal these days, and that suits my tastes just fine.

<h3>#1: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9uut54SANYZUefaKM54nLueL7_EAwCKk">To the Bone</a></strong> by Steven Wilson</h3>

<p>
  Well, I mean. Of course. Steven Wilson is on the list twice this year (also in the honorable mentions
  for his Blackfield collaboration). In just about any guiseâ€”solo, with Porcupine Tree, with
  Blackfield, or with Storm Corrosionâ€”he's going to make a favorite album of the year. Every solo
  album represents an evolution of sound; <a href="2015">2015</a>'s "Hand. Cannot. Erase." landed at
  #2 on my list. Some hardcore fans had trouble with this album, I suspect because at times we get as near
  to the happy version of Steven as has ever been recorded:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Here above the clouds;<br />
  I am free of all the crowds;<br />
  And I float above the stars;<br />
  And I feel the rush of love.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Hardcore fans be damned. This is a masterwork.
