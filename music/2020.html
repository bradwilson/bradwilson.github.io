<h1>Best Music of 2020 <a href="."><span class="fa fa-headphones"></span></a></h1>

<p>
    The global pandemic affected all aspects of our lives this year, and that includes music releases.
    A lot of bands found new ways to record, and with no tours to sell tickets and merchandise,
    I feel they could use our album purchases more than ever. My collection grew with 59 albums
    from 2020 as well as the usual catalog backfill.
</p>
<p>
    One category of music that really rose in prominence this year was, for lack of better
    terminology, "solo albums from rock/metal guitarists". Paul Wardingham regularly makes
    appearances on my list, but this year he's joined by strong albums from John Petrucci
    (Dream Theater, Liquid Tension Experiment), Kiko Loureiro (Megadeth, Angra), and Reb
    Beach (Winger, Whitesnake, Dokken). We also got a couple of genre-busting surprise albums
    from Taylor Swift, which would qualify as my top 2 favorites from her.
</p>
<p>
    All that said, progressive rock and metal tend to be my favorites, and this was an exceptional
    year for prog. There's a lot in my list to love for the prog fans. If you wish to be transported
    back to the 1970's with an album that sounds like the love child of Yes, King Crimson, and
    ELP, then definitely don't miss Wobbler's newest. Links to everything are below.

<h2>Top 6 albums of the year</h2>

    <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4QGge2UHMi919rLuBsC9im?si=-M9HP8h2Tou5NPf2kCmSSQ">Lucifer III</a></strong>
    by Lucifer
    <a href="#lucifer"><span class="fa fa-paperclip"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>
    The third album from German hard rock band Lucifer is my first exposure, and I find there's a lot
    to love in their 70's influenced occult tinged presentation. Johanna Sadonis is positively beguiling
    as the perfect front woman for the band. Their name will unfortunately mean that many in the US
    will likely never listen to their music; the subject matter is less of an issue as Sweden's Ghost
    has proved with their US explosion with their own 70's influence occult-centric
    <a href="2015#ghost">"Meliora"</a>, my favorite album of 2015. If you skip this album because of
    the name of the band, you're doing your ears a disservice.

    by The Pineapple Thief
    <a href="#the-pineapple-thief"><span class="fa fa-paperclip"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>
    The Pineapple Thief have been delivering solid progressive rock albums for more than 20 years. I heard
    this release described as a salve for the fact that Porcupine Tree are no longer recording music. In
    truth, the style of this album feels more like a blend of the heavier bits of Porcupine Tree and the
    more introspective pieces of Steven Wilson's solo career. It probably doesn't hurt that drum legend
    Gavin Harrison is playing with the band (and also played with Porcupine Tree); he has a uniquely
    colorful percussion style that permeates a lot of the music here to cause the comparison. Regardless,
    this is an extremely well done and enjoyable album on its own right and easily earned a slot on my
    list this year.

    <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1nIV5jr3c14glRyU3ax5PQ?si=tnyAthMXT4G1vQVBvuuRSQ">Rise Radiant</a></strong>
    by Caligula's Horse
    <a href="#caligulas-horse"><span class="fa fa-paperclip"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>
    The followup to 2017's "In Contact" and 2015's "Bloom" had pretty big shoes to fill. I consider Caligula's
    Horse to be one of the best modern progressive metal bands playing today, and this album certainly does
    a lot to cement that faith I have in them. This was one of my most anticipated albums of the year, and
    it has not disappointed even through what I imagine to now be running closer to a hundred plays than not.
    This is a perfectly crafted album: not just the writing, but also the recording and production care that
    went into providing us this welcome entry to their beloved catalog. Emotion and dynamics thread their way
    through the entire outing, and the experience is always enriching audibly and mentally.

    <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0fO1KemWL2uCCQmM22iKlj?si=mI_smfFkSwqOYh3McIAhzA">Fetch the Bolt Cutters</a></strong>
    by Fiona Apple
    <a href="#fiona-apple"><span class="fa fa-paperclip"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>
    Fiona Apple's debut album "Tidal" absolutely blew up the music world in 1996, and remains a mainstay in my
    musical collection today. Her followup "When the Pawn..." was another massive hit for the singer, and spent
    a lot of time in my rotation in the early 2000s. Between then and now, though, I can't honestly tell you much
    about what she's been up to, at least in part because of the fall of radio (for me) and rise of portable music
    inspired by the iPod which debuted the same year as her sophomore effort. I still have many great memories
    of that debut album, so it was with some trepidation that I bought this new album on the recommendation of
    a friend.
</p>
<p>
    Turns out I needn't have worried, because "Fetch the Bolt Cutters" is everything you'd hope for from a modernized
    version of Fiona Apple: still fiery and opinionated, with that incredible voice and sharp writing talent,
    refocused for 2020. I hope a new generation of listeners discovers this powerful and inspiring woman.

    <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/55aFOtepZx67RzARw2N2si?si=o47WJq3OTTyqnGXS31oJpA">Oceans of Slumber</a></strong>
    by Oceans of Slumber
    <a href="#oceans-of-slumber"><span class="fa fa-paperclip"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>
    I am, as always, entranced by the vocal style of Cammie Gilbert. The new self-titled album from Oceans
    of Slumber gives her many opportunities to show off a voice that would be just at home in a jazz club in
    the early 20th century as it does fronting a metal band in the 21st. The change in direction for this album
    is undoubtedly in part due to the substantial line-up change (both guitarists and the bass player are new,
    and two of the three provide backup vocals which include death-style growls). The sound on this album is
    even more lush and ambient than previous outings, and it becomes harder with every album to categorize them
    into any single genre. This is a band that deserves much more attention than it currently gets.

    by Enslaved
    <a href="#enslaved"><span class="fa fa-paperclip"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>
    Enslaved return with a fantastic new album, a followup to my <a href="2017#enslaved">2017 2nd place pick "E"</a>.
    This album is one that takes a few listens for the hooks to be fully embedded, but you expected nothing
    less than sonic perfection from the Norwegian progressive black metal standard bearers. From the harmonious
    chanting and tribal-feeling opening of "Fires in the Dark", through the post-punk inspired "Urjotun", and
    finally to the ambient-sounding and clean vocalized "Distant Seasons," this is surely their most diverse
    album, but still full of dark brooding power that epitomized the year for me.
