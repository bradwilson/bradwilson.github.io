<h1>Best Music of the 2010s <a href="."><span class="fa fa-headphones"></span></a></h1>

<p>
    I wanted to put together a list of the top 25 albums I've listened to for the decade. In some
    cases, these are albums that I didn't listen to before making my annual list, and in some cases
    they are albums that grew on me. It's impossible for me to rank these albums, so instead I'm just
    going to list them by year.
</p>

<p>
    I started with <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/bradwilson/status/1215405939164999681">a list
    of 70 albums</a> (no duplicates from any artist), and after struggling to bring the list down to 25, I
    decided I'd let the rest be here as honorable mentions. Whether the album made the main list or the
    honorable mentions, know that I believe they're all worth listening to.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4US3nmuLIKELhVZdBPiKxx">Tron: Legacy</a></strong> by Daft Punk</h3>

<p>
    The sequel to Tron wasn't much more than a two hour advertisement for the musical
    prowess of Daft Punk, set to neon lights and action scenes. And I'm 100% here for
    that. This is an excellent soundtrack, perfectly marrying what makes Daft Punk
    great with what made Tron such a part of my childhood memories.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5RILfwo6YNE096ns9gBP5F">Blood Like Lemonade</a></strong> by Morcheeba</h3>

<p>
    2010 includes two down-tempo bands in my list. Morcheeba's Blood Like Lemonade is not
    my absolute favorite album of theirs (that would go to 1998's Big Calm, likely), but
    this comes into the top 3 easily.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6rz0jrS5xRq1rArZWXz5lv">Mixed Race</a></strong> by Tricky</h3>

<p>
    I got my first Tricky album almost accidentally, while I was still married. I didn't really
    know much about trip-hop, much less did I appreciate it at the time, but now I'm a huge
    fan of Tricky, and this album in particular. The calming down-tempo beats are a great
    way to wind down after a long day.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6I6rZw3H59ka6nDYsXcpDC">Heritage</a></strong> by Opeth</h3>

<p>
    Heritage represents Opeth's first album after lead singer Mikael Åkerfeldt abandoned the
    death metal growl. It would take several albums before their transition from extreme metal
    to progress rock would be complete, and Heritage represents the first step along the way:
    all clean vocals, but still much of the rest of the melodic metal sensibilities that drove
    the majority of their career.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6doeWbRhzrQlaaUKniuckp">For True</a></strong> by Trombone Shorty</h3>

<p>
    My friend Steve and I share a decades-long love of a very brief part of Harry Connick,
    Jr.'s musical career, encompassed by two albums: "She" and "Star Turtle". Unlike anything else
    he's done before or since, those albums drove a love of modern pop-infused jazz. Knowing
    our shared feelings for these albums, he told me I should get "For True" by Trombone
    Shorty, as the sort of spiritual successor to those albums. He's created an effortless
    fusion of modern pop, R&amp;B, and New Orleans jazz. I've never failed to create a fan
    with this album.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/76FXHQhTuT4QMIxfL09gX8">The Heist</a></strong> by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis</h3>

<p>
    I'd be shocked if you didn't know about Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis. This album was one
    of the biggest of the year, for good reason: infection beats and an impeccable vocal
    flow, combined with some incredibly shrewd collaborations like Ray Dalton, Wanz, and
    Mary Lambert. Filled with positive messages and happiness, you can't help but get
    out of your chair and dance along.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1KgxPozC9yqcbujyOUFIAR">The Afterman</a></strong> by Coheed & Cambria</h3>

<p>
    Originally released as a two disc set (Ascension in 2012 and Descension in 2013), this
    continues Coheed's progressive rock multi-album Amory Wars storyline. The deluxe edition
    featuring both albums included a hardcover coffee table book.
</p>
<p>
    Via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Afterman:_Ascension">Wikipedia</a>:
    "The double album tells the story of Sirius Amory, the namesake of the concept, as he explores
    the energy source holding together the Keywork (the 78 worlds in which the Amory Wars is set)
    and finds that it is in fact a horrible afterlife for departed souls."

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4jvfINK922vXYKLBcdsZXd">Brief Nocturnes and Dreamless Sleep</a></strong> by Spock's Beard</h3>

<p>
    I discovered Spock's Beard in the early 2000s, just in time for their double album
    concept record "Snow". Not long after, lead singer Neal Morse left the band to start
    a Christian progressive rock music solo career; drummer Nick D'Virgilio took over the
    vocal duties with the blessing or Morse (whose brother Alan remains in the band). They
    struggled a bit to find direction without Neal's writing, and Nick ended up leaving the
    band in 2011. Ted Leonard joined, and 2013's "Brief Nocturnes and Dreamless Sleep"
    finally felt like Beard was back and clicking with their pop-infused prog style.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/19dUbDF1ePsbwjflBxFfVm">The Quantum Enigma</a></strong> by Epica</h3>

<p>
    It's no secret that I have a real soft spot for female-fronted metal bands, and symphonic power
    metal band Epica is one of my favorites. Clean vocalist Simone Simmons is one of the best around,
    and this album is the peak of their style. It won't go un-listened for long; when I have the desire
    for high throttle symphonic metal, this is what I constantly reach for.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4BX2URR8ee6P2aQFvee2yF">Citadel</a></strong> by Ne Obliviscaris</h3>

<p>
    Ne Obliviscaris is a fairly recent discovery for me, so I didn't listen to this album when it
    first came out. The Australian extreme metal band is best known for both mixing death-style
    growls and clean vocals, along with virtuoso-level violins. The melodic hooks that permeate
    their music are incredible and awe inspiring.
</p>

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/17Tfoe9VyspYtjTXdB6fye">The Singularity (Phase 1: Neohumanity)</a></strong> by Scar Symmetry</h3>

<p>
    At this point, it should be obvious that I have a real jones for metal that mixes extreme
    metal growls with clean vocals, especially with heavy melodic tendencies. Scar Symmetry pretty
    much own this genre for me. The first in a promised trilogy, the album examines the notion
    of the rise of AI (which they call artilects) and how it ends up leading to a time of
    transhumanism, merging artilects and human flesh to usher in an era of post-humanity. The
    worst part of this album is that we're still waiting for Phase 2: Xenotaph, which had
    originally been promised for 2017.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7lxHnls3yQNl8B9bILmHj7">Traveller</a></strong> by Chris Stapleton</h3>

<p>
    Chris is a perfect blend of classic country and blues, with a voice that is like emotional
    smoke. He is often accompanied by his wife, whose voice is a fantastic match for his in harmony.
    He's best known for his cover of David Allen Coe's "Tennessee Whiskey", which had been previously
    made famous by George Jones. There is a fantastic duet version between Chris and Justin Timberlake
    performed at the Country Music Awards in 2015 (where they also covered JT's "Drink You Away"). That
    said, this album is packed with great songs, especially "Fire Away" with its incredibly impactful video.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3bChCUtpRC1NaCLYD4unbD">Meliora</a></strong> by Ghost</h3>

<p>
    I happened onto Ghost during the period of their second album, the heavily Latin (language, not culture)
    influenced "Infestissumam". I jokingly described them as "the nicest bunch of Satanists you'll ever meet".
    The musical style is heavily tongue-in-cheek, as evidenced by their videos styles being heavily influenced
    by things like 70's horror movies. It was Meliora, though, that turned Ghost from an interesting band
    into one that could tour stadiums. Their songs are incredibly hook-filled pop metal affairs.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6QKC7ltfafdNeBZkzLdUvF">The Book of Souls</a></strong> by Iron Maiden</h3>

<p>
    While Iron Maiden flirted with progressive tendencies in their early career, they've embraced it wholeheartedly
    in their latter years, in a way that is distinctly Iron Maiden. All the signatures are there: long song length,
    multiple styles blended together, intricate parts, time changes, etc., but it's always done in a way that feels
    distinctly Maiden. Amazingly, they stay impressive in live shows, where they've always excelled.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6P7vL4vGgyrD7q9VR9BcnV">Hand. Cannot. Erase.</a></strong> by Steven Wilson</h3>

<p>
    Steven Wilson is progressive rock royalty. There's no other way to say it; he represents the pinnacle of
    modern prog. His band Porcupine Tree remains one of my all time favorites, but his solo work has a bit more
    of his personal soul infused into it. "Hand. Cannot. Erase." is a masterwork album, packed front to back
    with some of the best music ever made in any genre. I dare you not to cry during the video for "Routine".

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="">Proponent for Sentience</a></strong> by Allegaeon</h3>

<p>
    Allegaeon is a technical death metal band from Colorado that has a hard taking itself
    seriously in its videos. The music is brutal in execution and precision, and yet it
    doesn't create boredom like some technical metal can. It's very difficult to pick a
    favorite album, so I basically tossed a five-sided coin. 😁 This album includes an
    excellent cover of Rush's "Subdivisions", which seemed like an appropriate choice
    given the recent unexpected passing of Rush drummer Neil Peart.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1lCmbNOMbDw1QeFzWGWLbR">Winter's Gate</a></strong> by Insomnium</h3>

<p>
    This album is a single 40 minute track. A melodic death metal masterpiece. Need I say more?
    The record company split it up into 7 parts on YouTube, so here's the first 6 minutes. If you
    have even a vague affinity for this style of music, this is likely to become a favorite album.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/384vCqFNNWXumypoRHeKDN">E</a></strong> by Enslaved</h3>

<p>
    Enslaved are a staple of the melodic black metal community; "E" is their fourteenth studio album.
    Much like Opeth, they have become the standard bearer for the mixing of brutal extreme vocals
    and clean vocals. Their musicianship and song-writing here is the best of their career, and this
    is one hell of a memorable musical treat.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3tsVTG0T8XtHdGGiwd3WRr">Everybody</a></strong> by Logic</h3>

<p>
    I was a pretty big fan of "The Incredible True Story", the album that precedes "Everybody", so
    I was really anticipating this release. It blew my expectations out of the water. Logic has some
    of the most incredible flow in rap, and this song writing is more than up to the standard.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6KUyRDNTNkQkXgRapEiUKF">Ballads</a></strong> by Paula Cole</h3>

<p>
    Paula Cole is best known for "I Don't Want To Wait," the song from her second studio album that
    ended up as the title music for the TV series "Dawson's Creek." The front end of her career was
    definitely filled with pop-radio friendly hits that garnered her great attention. In truth, though,
    Cole's heart has always belonged to the jazz standards that she grew up loving, and she yearned to do
    covers that did those songs justice.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2PjlaxlMunGOUvcRzlTbtE">Dirty Computer</a></strong> by Janelle Monáe</h3>

<p>
    Janelle Monáe was a fixture of 2000/2010s pop radio with her blend of R&amp;B and funk with hip
    hop styling. In 2016, she starred in the Oscar nominated Hidden Figures as Mary Jackson, one of
    the trio of NASA "computers" that helped get John Glenn into space. She followed this up with
    the absolute knock out 2018 album "Dirty Computer," a concept album that she described as an
    homage to women and sexual identity.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6Ue1iqByWrHTVFUkTpnm7D">Where Owls Know My Name</a></strong> by Rivers of Nihil</h3>

<p>
    I missed this album when it first came out, or else it surely would've made my list for 2018,
    possibly at the top (as you'd expect for an album on this list). It's hard to describe the style
    of the band and album, other than to say that it has some of the best saxophone ever recorded in
    metal. You heard me. Check out the psychedelic-infused video for the title track.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/03T9bKKlfydmgyarZCKlDo">Devouring Radiant Light</a></strong> by Skeletonwitch</h3>

<p>
    This was actually my pick for my favorite album of 2018, and it's still in regular rotation.
    It came to my attention based on a mediocre review that lamented the change in vocal style,
    but it was definitely something that now resonated with me. Two years later, I still can't
    get enough of the incredible melodies and writing on this album.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/097DmmcskEDBUEgFJaIbvG">The Wake</a></strong> by Voivod</h3>

<p>
    Voivod is a Canadian metal band that's been around for nearly 40 years. Their early career
    was marked mostly by their punk-tinged political metal. Their modern sound is more clearly
    rooted in progressive metal, and The Wake offers a sound that's distinctly Voivod, as though
    it's been pulled through a time machine from 100 years in the future.

<h3><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5XpEKORZ4y6OrCZSKsi46A">Norman Fucking Rockwell!</a></strong> by Lana Del Rey</h3>

<p>
    This album has absolutely gotten under my skin during 2019, and even more so as we've gone into
    2020. Though I've listened to some of the more metal-focused albums more in 2019 (especially those
    from Jinjer and Insomnium), I find that I've grown almost emotionally attached to Lana's incredible
    voice and song writing. Her cover of Sublime's "Doin' Time" is one of those rare treatments that
    outshines the original, slowing it down slightly and infusing it with an incredible down-tempo
    treatment. The nine and a half minute "Venice Bitch", though, remains my absolute favorite.
    I debated moving this higher in my 2019 picks, and I should've listened to that instinct.
