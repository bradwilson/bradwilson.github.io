<h1>Best Music of 2010 <a href="."><span class="fas fa-headphones"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  Time for the annual "best music of the year" post. As usual, tons of great
  music this year; thank god for the Internet, because none of this stuff makes
  it on the radio. :)
</p>

<h2>Genre: Metal</h2>

<h3>Agalloch - Marrow of the Spirit</h3>

<p>
  Agalloch are an intensely emotional experience. Calling them a black metal band
  does some disservice to their range. Their new album is an aural experience
  unlike anything else from this year.

<h3>Allegaeon - Fragments of Form and Function</h3>

<p>
  These guys destroy me. I can't believe this is their first full length album.
  Super-solid melodic death metal, and this song in particular is outstanding,
  especially the acoustic guitar solo at the end.

<h3>Fear Factory - Mechanize</h3>

<p>Dino Cazares is back, and this is the best Fear Factory has ever sounded, IMO.</p>

<h3>Kamelot - Poetry For the Poisoned</h3>

<p>
  Kamelot can do no wrong in my eyes. I love the vocalist, probably one of the best
  metal singers in the business.

<h3>Opeth - In Live Concert At Royal Albert Hall</h3>

<p>
  The unique grandfathers of progressive death metal have been around for 20 years,
  and decided to celebrate by touring only 6 venues, playing their masterwork
  Blackwater Park in its entirely, plus one song from every other album. That may
  not sound like a lot, but many Opeth sounds run 8-10 minutes long, so this was
  easily more than an hour of extra material.

<h3>Solution .45 - For Aeons Past</h3>

<p>
  Every Scar Symmetry fan was sad when Christian Ã„lvestam announced he was leaving
  the band, only to be replaced by two singers. Thankfully he didn't disappear
  for long!
</p>

<h3>Vanden Plas - The Seraphic Clockwork</h3>

<p>
  The last few Vanden Plas albums have been just stellar examples of progressive
  metal, and this was no exception.

<h2>Genre: Everything Else</h2>

<h3>Coheed and Cambria - Year of the Black Rainbow</h3>

<p>
  Coheed and Cambria have finally finished their five-album series describing
  Amory Wars. One wonders what's next for the band, given that telling this story
  has consumed the last 15 years of their lives (and the entirety of their career).
</p>

<h3>James LaBrie - Static Impulse</h3>

<p>
  "Disappointed" barely covers my feelings when I heard the news of Mike Portnoy's
  departure from Dream Theater. This solo album from DT's lead singer has helped
  me cope. :)

<h3>Slash</h3>

<p>
  Slash wrote songs for several prominent musicians and recorded it all together
  into this one superb cross-genre album. It's a showcase for the talent of his
  guests even more than himself, which just goes to show how good a song-writer
  he is.

<h3>Morcheeba - Blood Like Lemonade</h3>

<p>
  Morcheeba are one of my all-time favorite downtempo bands, and the new album
  has several excellent tracks on it.
</p>

<h3>Tron: Legacy Soundtrack by Daft Punk</h3>

<p>
  If you watch Tron: Legacy as a two-hour Daft Punk video with some story-telling
  tossed in, it plays a lot better than as a stand-alone movie.
