<h1>Best Music of 2015 <a href="."><span class="fas fa-headphones"></span></a></h1>

<p>
  This year I've decided to switch the format up to a "top 5" system, and use honorable mentions for things that
  were very good, but didn't make the cut.
</p>

<h2>Top 5 albums of the year</h2>

<h3>#5: <strong>Under the Red Cloud</strong> by Amorphis</h3>

<p>
  Finnish metal band Amorphis have charted a strange career, starting with a melodic death metal sound that
  peaked with the masterpiece album <strong>Tales from the Thousand Lakes</strong>, a quick stop over into traditional
  clean melodic metal for a few albums (the best being <strong>Am Universum</strong>), then finally landing on a hybrid
  sound that combines both parts of their history. <strong>Under the Red Cloud</strong> is their 12th studio album, and
  easily the best of their current lineup.

<h3>#4: <strong>25</strong> by Adele</h3>

<p>
  What can I say about Adele that hasn't already been said 100 times over? The long gap between the last album
  and this one (not to mention motherhood and vocal cord surgery) caused many to wonder whether she'd still be
  able to produce a relevant record. While the first single <strong>Hello</strong> is widely acclaimed, I'm a bigger fan
  of <strong>When We Were Young</strong>.

<h3>#3: <strong>Juggernaut</strong> by Periphery</h3>

<p>
  This was my first introduction to now 10-year-old Periphery, an American extreme metal band. This year
  they released two CDs: the soaring <strong>Juggernaut &#xb7; Alpha</strong> and the dirging <strong>Juggernaut &#xb7; Omega</strong>,
  a great juxtaposition that showcases a band with great vision and a long future. The albums demand to be listened to
  in long-play form, as there are no real singles (and barely song divisions).

<h3>#2: <strong>Hand. Cannot. Erase.</strong> by Steven Wilson</h3>

<p>
  Steven Wilson is the brains behind progressive rock standard-bearer Porcupine Tree, as well as several
  collaborations (including Blackfield and Storm Corrosion). His solo work has always been his most personal,
  and in some cases that made it challenging to listen to. This year's release, though, is an absolute
  masterwork. I was immediately hooked by the the drum &amp; bass opening on <strong>3 Years Older</strong>. My
  hands down favorite is the sadly haunting <strong>Routine</strong>.

<h3 id="ghost">#1: <strong>Meliora</strong> by Ghost</h3>

<p>
  The 3rd full length album from Swedish metal band Ghost is not only my favorite of the year,
  but probably by favorite of the decade so far (and given the lofty company, such as last year's
  phenomenal release by Opeth, that's truly saying something).
</p>

<p>
  For those not in the know, Ghost is a satirical metal band which performs satanic metal songs.
  None of the actual human identies in the band are known (though several are suspected), as the
  singer goes by Papa Emeritus III, and the other 5 members are listed simply as Nameless
  Ghouls. (This is the third Papa Emeritus, one for each album, though most believe it's the same
  person, given his fairly unique vocal qualities).
</p>

<p>
  Their music videos have historically cribbed the style of cheesy low-budget horror and sci-fi movies
  from the 70's and earlier. The two videos released in 2015 follow the pattern, with <strong>Cirice</strong>
  looking a lot like a Stephen King short story, and <strong>From the Pinacle to the Pit</strong> showing a
  strong homage to German filmmaker Fritz Lang. My personal favorite song is <strong>Zenith</strong>, which
  was only available on the very limited edition vinyl print of the album.
